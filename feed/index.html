				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You may be wondering if or when the Charmd offices will begin offering in-person appointments again and what we are doing to keep everyone as safe as possible. While we cannot guarantee that there is no risk of exposure to COVID-19 within our office spaces, we can follow recommended guidelines as much as possible and make collaborative decisions with you about your care. Our latest newsletter outlined some of the details we consider when making the decision to re-open and welcome staff as well as clients back into our office spaces. It is not a simple decision to make and so each therapist will make his or her own choices while considering their own health status and risk, the health status and risk of their clients, and what is most clinically appropriate for each individual client.</p>
<p>This brief video will give you an idea of what we are doing as well as what to expect if you do come in for an appointment. Following the CDC and state guidelines as well as the guidelines from our professional organizations, our primary recommendation continues to be to receive your care via <a href="https://www.bluestoneps.com/telehealth-counseling/">telehealth.</a> You are welcome to bring any questions to your therapist.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Change can be hard, even if it’s anticipated and welcome. So far 2020 has brought us momentous opportunities to practice mindful acceptance, grow our resilience, and deepen our understanding of ourselves and how we care for each other. As our landscape continues to evolve and change, we, the employees and independent therapists at Charmdllc, remain committed to your emotional health and well-being. We are at Charmd because we are purpose driven: to be agents of change and healing in the lives of those around us. One of our core values is Honor. By this we mean honoring you as the unique human you are and treating all our fellow humans with dignity and respect.</p>
<p>Everyone connected to Charmdllc, be it as an employee or as one of our independent clinicians, agrees with this core value and strives to walk their talk. We do this by doing our own work through training, reading, our own therapy, and talking openly and honestly with each other. While we can’t always know what our blind spots are, we want to. If you become aware of one of our blind spots, we want to hear from you!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello Charmd Connections Readers!</p>
<p>We are thinking of you all during this challenging time and hoping you and your loved ones are doing well. There are some of you whom we haven’t seen in a while because the initial stay home order was only set to last for 15 days so it didn’t seem like a big deal to wait. Now, however, you may find the stress we are all living with is beginning to grow and take its toll. This may be especially true now that the duration of our required social distancing is extended through April and the news about COVID-19 is not actually getting better or more reassuring.</p>
<p>As we settle into our new normal, I encourage you to consider your self-care more strongly than ever. This is not a sprint but a long-distance event that you will need stamina for to get through. With telehealth being easier to get now, and many insurance companies waiving some consumer’s costs (waived copays, for example, with some insurers), <strong>this is a great time to get started on your journey toward emotional wellness through <a href="https://www.bluestoneps.com/telehealth-counseling/">video counseling</a>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Here are some ideas to keep yourself strong:</strong></p>
<h2>1. Exercise, exercise, exercise!</h2>
<p>It’s clear that since COVID-19, we are moving less and missing out on reducing biochemical stress (being more sedentary delays the release of cortisol and other biological consequences of stress) as well as biomechanical stress (with decreased activity our muscles aren’t releasing physiological tension). We are also missing the opportunity of building the feel-good hormones and maintaining a felt sense of balance and strength in our bodies and the improved cognitive clarity and focus that come with exercise.</p>
<p>There are many ways to exercise even while social distancing:</p>
<p>a. Fortunately, Spring is on its way. Being out of doors can actually be a relief now! It’s a prefect time to get to the walking, running, or biking you’ve been thinking about.</p>
<p>b. Check out your gym’s or studio’s webpage and see if they are live streaming any of their classes.</p>
<p>c. There are a ton of apps and videos available that you can try out – many have free trial periods or are free all the time.</p>
<p>d. Make it fun for the whole family – each family member can take turns finding a free exercise session on YouTube and everyone can do it together. Break into teams, each learning a dance routine and then have a dance off. Create a family Olympics where everyone decides what they want to work on and what their personal best goal is – and then cheer each other on!</p>
<h2>2. Develop a spiritual/contemplative practice.</h2>
<p>We often think this would be a good idea, hear that it is something we “should” do. With more time at home, this could be a perfect opportunity to:</p>
<p>a. Download that inspiring book you’ve always wanted to read from a book store or the library.</p>
<p>b. Watch a movie or Ted Talk that gets you thinking about deeper/bigger things rather than encourages you tune out.</p>
<p>c. Download that meditation app your friend told you about ages ago and give it a try.</p>
<p>d. Ever have a church or other place you thought looked interesting but never had the time to actually go to? Many are now live streaming their lectures/services from their websites and/or social media. It’s a perfect time to check them out!</p>
<p>e. Try journaling – if nothing else, this is a very strange time of constricted movement, changed work/school environment and habits, a major pandemic, and more. There’s certainly more to reflect on and write about!</p>
<h2>3. Take COVID-19 breaks.</h2>
<p>I cannot emphasize this enough! The news about C-19 is constant and yet, relatively little of it is giving us new information. It’s typically report after report about the strain on our medical facilities, risks to medical personnel, threats to our wellbeing, news of increasing numbers of cases and deaths, borders closing and restricted travel around the world, what the latest expert says or politician is or isn’t doing. All the fear and negativity wreaks havoc on our emotions and our bodies.</p>
<p>Here are some ideas to take a break from it all:</p>
<p>a. Decide on one or two news sources you trust and want to follow and then only check in on them once or twice a day for a set amount of time each.</p>
<p>b. Take up gardening. Even if all you have is a tiny balcony, you can start growing vegetable and flower starts to move into a bigger pot as the season progresses. For those with bigger yard space, there’s certainly plenty of Spring clean up to be done now. Maybe this is the year to build that special patio to relax on or rethink a part of your garden beds. You can start preparing those spaces now. You can try growing things from seed, try propagating from plants you already have.</p>
<p>c. There are many “normal” things happening right now too. Make it a point to look for those, notice them, feel them in your body. Is there a favorite tree that is beginning to bloom again? Are you noticing how much longer day light is with us now? Are there certain birds that are coming back to visit the new flowers and berries around you. Take the time to observe and feel it in your body.</p>
<p>d. Get inspired by art and beauty and share it with those important to you:</p>
<p>i. Create new playlists that support your emotional wellbeing.</p>
<p>ii. Find photographs, pieces of art, poems, dance performances, anything that help you express what is in your heart, focusing on gratitude, love, hope.</p>
<p>These are unprecedented times. My grandparents talked about the Great Depression. Relatives talked about living through WWII. My generation had 9-11. Our young people will talk about living through the COVID-19 pandemic. It’s longer term impact on our culture has yet to be seen. While we’re in this part of the experience, there are a number of choices we can make to care for ourselves and to keep our mental, emotional and physical selves strong.</p>
<p><strong>If there is anything we can do for you, please do not hesitate to reach out.</strong> Appointment times are available for new and returning clients. If you’re concerned that having a counseling appointment by video would feel strange or be complicated, please reach out. We would be happy to walk you through the process, including a free 10 minute practice run through so you can learn just how easy it is. <a href="https://www.bluestoneps.com/telehealth-counseling/">Click here</a> for more information about telehealth.</p>
<p>And, in the midst of all this, we are excited to announce a new addition to our panel of therapists. <a href="https://www.bluestoneps.com/therapists-counselors-edmonds/sara-magdaleno-msw-licsw/">Sara Magdaleno, MSW, LICSW</a> brings her talents and interest in working with clients aged 12 through adult to our office. See below for more information.</p>
<p>Take care and be well!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>As of Monday, March 23rd, We&#8217;ve Gone 100% Virtual!</h2>
<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 75%; height: 0;"><iframe style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;" src="https://www.loom.com/embed/72ad395e53ea4c8dbd209b9d6a9fbe44" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div>
<p>Hello Everyone!</p>
<p>First, I want to say thank you for taking this unexpected journey with us. These are rapidly changing times, requiring us all to be flexible and shift to new ways of doing things. How we “go to work,” how the kids still “go to school,” how we connect with our friends and families, as well as how we engage in previous activities that we’d taken for granted has all been turned upside down. This has, of course, also impacted how we run the Charmd office and engage in therapy, both as clients and as therapists.</p>
<p>I look forward to the day when we are looking at this experience in the rear-view mirror but realize this may go on for some time. In response to our state lawmakers and CDC guidelines to minimize exposure, we have spent this last week finalizing how we will move Charmd operations, therapy and medication management services into the digital world. You may have already heard from your therapist, but if you haven’t,<strong> on Monday, March 23rd, Charmd is moving all of its services to a telehealth format.</strong> I am happy to say, we are gaining fluidity and confidence in the new procedures and so are our clients. We are so pleased to be getting really positive feedback from those clients who have already tried it!</p>
<p>I wanted to send you all a note about what this move to telehealth means for you:</p>
<p><strong>1. Your therapists are ready for you!</strong> We have a fully HIPAA compliant video and phone system for telehealth and all of our therapists are trained in how to use it. They have training in delivering telehealth and have actually found it working quite well with the sessions they have already done. <strong>You are important to us and we want to be here with you and for you.</strong> At least through March, some of the HIPAA restrictions have been lifted, making it easier for telehealth services to be provided. You can meet us by phone and/or through our video platform, which clients have found easy to learn.</p>
<p><strong>2. Nothing has changed in our <a href="https://www.bluestoneps.com/patient-portal/">Patient Portal</a>,</strong> w<strong>hich you can continue to access from our website.</strong> You can still manage appointments, update information, and email your therapist confidentially using your same user name and password.</p>
<p>To reach your therapist most easily, please call their extensions:</p>
<p><strong>Randie Clark, x708</strong><br />
<strong>Emily Visser, x710</strong><br />
<strong>Terri Buysse, x706</strong></p>
<p><strong>Julie Hanson, x 701</strong><br />
<strong>Terri Haaga, x714</strong><br />
<strong>Kristi Leksen, x704</strong></p>
<p><strong>Bill Roedel, x 702</strong><br />
<strong>Cherrie Palmer, x712</strong><br />
<strong>Stephanie Bates, x705</strong></p>
<p><strong>Doralissa Griffin, x707</strong><br />
<strong>Kristin Mendoza, x703</strong><br />
<strong>Skye Camphouse, x716</strong></p>
<p><strong>3. Please do not terminate your care.</strong> These are unprecedented times and I know you may feel like you can’t possibly do one more thing, take one more change. While I appreciate the jokes about how busy maternity wards will be in nine months, I am also aware of how stress and disruption in routines that are outside of our control can wreak havoc on our patience, communication skills, sleep, energy levels, and moods. Keeping the support of and connection with your therapist can help you navigate this uninvited time of change and come out strong.</p>
<p>If you do feel a need to end care for a while, we encourage you to have a termination appointment so we can help you build up your care plan going forward. When compared to an unplanned, abrupt ending, a planned termination has been shown to significantly improve a client’s success after care. If you still want to end your care, at least for now, and would like to return at a later time, just give us a call and we will get you back on your therapist’s schedule as soon as we can. We unfortunately cannot hold appointment times indefinitely.</p>
<p>4. If you had already ended a previous episode of care and now want to return, just give Kayla a call or send us an email at <a href="mailto:wehelp@charmdllc.com">wehelp@charmdllc.com</a>. You may find yourself slipping a bit as you go through all these changes. This is completely understandable and we welcome the opportunity to reconnect you with your therapist or match you with a new one. If you are working from home, you may have greater flexibility in your schedule. Not having to travel to and from the office may make it easier to fit an appointment into your day. We can vary lengths of appointments to help with cost and time constraints. Just let us know if you’d like to “come in” for a booster!</p>
<p><strong>5. We will need to verify the benefits again for several insurance plans.</strong> Many insurance companies have had a strong, supportive response in order to decrease barriers to telehealth services, which has been wonderful! However, it is not true for all insurance plans. This is most notable with self-funded plans. We want to decrease stress for you as much as possible, so please be patient as we attempt to verify telehealth benefits for each of you. You may receive a call or new payment agreement form about this from Rachel or Asya in our billing department, or from your therapist. You are also welcome to give billing a call or send an email to <a href="mailto:wehelp@charmdllc.com">wehelp@charmdllc.com</a>.</p>
<p>For now, please just come to your appointments and we will figure out the other bits as we go, including considering sliding fees for those who have lost jobs and income during this time. Varying the lengths of appointments can also help mediate cost, if needed. Let’s work together!</p>
<p><strong>6. Our staff are ready for you!</strong> We are still “here” at the same email addresses and phone numbers. Kayla is still available for front desk tasks at <strong>425-775-4059, x2</strong> and <a href="mailto:wehelp@charmdllc.com">wehelp@charmdllc.com</a>. Rachel and Asya are still available for billing questions at <strong>425-775-4059, x3</strong> and <a href="mailto:wehelp@charmdllc.com">wehelp@charmdllc.com</a>.</p>
<p>We love what we do and being able to answer the call to be of service. We look forward to continuing your care with as little disruption to you as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Please keep looking for and reading the newsletters and therapist emails you will be receiving with greater frequency now so we can stay in communication with you. I will also be posting updates here on our website</strong><strong style="font-size: 1rem;"> and our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/BluestonePS/?__tn__=%2Cd%2CP-R&amp;eid=ARAo0XJrd1Qvx5-j7RR9TjCIGjs9SX96j6RJxIhzzccbBWmN3B_gp5ibRdUHPwB-RUuyD0cJniSDp1Z5">Facebook page</a>.</strong></p>
<p>Here’s to your health and seeing you on the other side!</p>
<p>Take very good care,</p>
<p>Julie Hanson, Psy.D,. LMHC<br />
Director, Charmd Psychological Services</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Valentine&#8217;s Day has long been known as a holiday that celebrates love and romance.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Valentine&#8217;s Day has long been known as a holiday that celebrates love and romance. While most people think of this as a holiday for couples, there&#8217;s nothing that says romantic love is the only kind worth celebrating.</p>
<p>Whether or not you&#8217;re currently part of a happy couple, opening your mind and expanding your thoughts about love can give you a whole new perspective. Here are a few ways to honor different types of love all month long.</p>
<h2>Focus on Your Family and Friends</h2>
<p>Many of us have a special bond with at least one family member. Take a moment to think about all the good times you&#8217;ve had together and see how that makes you feel. Then, reach out and let them know just how much you love and appreciate them.</p>
<p>The same goes for friends. If you have a best friend who has been there for you through thick and thin, use this opportunity to tell them what their love and support means to you. Have a close-knit group of friends? Make plans to spend some time together so you can all appreciate the love you have for one another.</p>
<h2>Appreciate Your Pet&#8217;s Unconditional Love</h2>
<p>Few things can make you feel more special than the unconditional love of an animal. If you have a pet in your life, take some extra time this month to cuddle, play, or just bask in their affection. Maybe even pick up a special treat or a new toy to show your love in a language they understand.</p>
<p>If you sometimes feel like you love your dog more than most people, you&#8217;re not alone. In fact, a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/humans-love-dogs-more-than-other-humans-2017-11">recent study</a> showed that many people feel more empathy for dogs than their fellow humans. There&#8217;s also nothing wrong with letting your dog snuggle up in bed with you. <a href="https://nypost.com/2018/11/27/women-sleep-better-next-to-dogs-than-humans-study/">Another study</a> showed that most women actually sleep better next to their dogs than they do next to their human partners! So count yourself in good company and enjoy your time with the furry love of your life.</p>
<h2>Learn to Love Life&#8217;s Little Joys</h2>
<p>Perhaps one of the most important life lessons is that you don&#8217;t actually need a companion at all to experience the thrill of love. Start paying extra attention to the things you really enjoy doing and the way they make you feel.</p>
<p>When you&#8217;re engaged in your favorite activity, does your heart beat a little bit faster? Do you feel a bit of a tingle or flutter? When you&#8217;re done, do you have a feeling of fulfillment or satisfaction? Guess what &#8212; that&#8217;s love too!</p>
<h2>Celebrate Love in Different Ways All Month Long</h2>
<p>Once you begin honoring different kinds of love, you&#8217;ll feel incredibly fulfilled and have a whole new sense of satisfaction. This new outlook will also bring a renewed sense of joy that you can celebrate during the Month of Love and throughout the rest of the year.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Losing a loved one, whether through death, divorce or a break up, is never easy. When the holidays come around, the weight of your sadness and grief can feel almost crippling. The joy of those around you, pressure to celebrate, and the loss of previously cherished traditions can make every day seem unbearable.</p>
<p>So, how do you get through this unavoidable time when you really just want to sit this one out or wake up when it’s over? While every person’s experience is different, the following coping methods can help you survive the holidays after a loss.</p>
<h2>1. Don’t Put Too Much Pressure on Yourself</h2>
<p>You’re not feeling like yourself this year, and that’s okay. Don’t put too much pressure on yourself to celebrate the same way you did before. If you don’t feel like cooking on Thanksgiving or shopping for gifts, then don’t.</p>
<p>Communicate with your family and friends. Let them know that you just don’t feel up to it and ask for help. They will understand and will be thankful to have an opportunity to make things a bit easier for you.</p>
<h2>2. Create New Traditions</h2>
<p>Reminiscing about cherished traditions after the loss of a loved one or relationship can feel good as well as break your heart. Don’t try to force yourself to keep them going unless you’re really sure that you want to.</p>
<p>Whether it’s putting up decorations, cooking a certain dish, or watching a favorite holiday movie, if the thought of it feels like too much, then give yourself permission to let it go. In the years to come, you’ll either find that interest again or you’ll create new traditions that make the most sense for your changed life.</p>
<h2>3. Take Time for Yourself</h2>
<p>While you don’t want to isolate yourself too much when you’re grieving, you still may find that you need more time for yourself than you did before. Don’t get so caught up in the hustle and bustle of the holidays that you let your self-care slip. It’s more important now than ever. Take naps when you need them, take some time away from work, and recognize when you need to be alone as well as with others.</p>
<p>Holidays tend to be busy with lots of guests around. If things start to feel overwhelming, don’t be afraid to put on your coat and go for a walk or retreat to a quiet room until you feel like you can handle being around people again.</p>
<h2>4. Supporting Your Children</h2>
<p>If you have children, give them space to talk about their feelings of grief and invite them to let you know what they want to make sure you still do during the holidays. Their world has also changed and they will benefit from feeling a sense of control and reassurance that it’s okay to feel happy too. They won’t hurt anyone’s feelings and you may even find a bit of cheer for yourself along the way.</p>
<h2>5. Give Yourself Permission to Feel Sadness and Joy</h2>
<p>While the holidays can make you feel like you need to be happy all the time, this simply isn’t true. Remember that it’s okay to cry. It’s okay to miss your loved one and feel sad about creating a new future without them. Take the time to acknowledge your feelings and let yourself experience them as they are.</p>
<p>Also, don’t beat yourself up when you find yourself smiling, feeling content, or even experiencing joy. Happy moments will come to you, and when they do, give yourself permission to embrace them. No matter how you feel, be authentic. There is no right or wrong way to get through this, and trying to push yourself into something that doesn’t feel right simply takes too much effort.</p>
<h2>Some Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>It may not feel like it right now, but, eventually, life without your loved one will get easier. While the memories of times past will always have a special place in your heart, you’ll also begin to make new memories, create new traditions, and build a life you love living. For now, just settle for taking one day at a time and doing the best you can. That’s all anyone can ask of you and all you should ask of yourself.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s back to school time. It is both an exciting time and a time of transition that can bring challenges. Do you find that your child lacks enthusiasm or doesn&#8217;t quite seem to be acting like themselves? It could be the indication of a more serious issue. Here are a few reasons your child could be struggling:</p>
<h2>1.  Bullying</h2>
<p>From threatening violence and stealing lunch money to spreading vicious rumors, kids have always been faced with bullying. In today&#8217;s online world, however, the problem has reached a whole new level. Cyberbullying can occur around the clock, meaning that children find it difficult to escape, even when they&#8217;re &#8220;safe&#8221; at home.</p>
<p>With school back in session, children are more likely to experience bullying in the coming months. Signs of bullying are often hard to identify but if your child is experiencing bullying, you may notice your child being:</p>
<ul>
<li>More moody than usual or more sensitive to perceived slights from others and</li>
<li>Wanting to avoid certain situations where the incidents are likely to occur  (like riding the bus). They often develop</li>
<li>Symptoms of anxiety or stress like complaining of an upset stomach, not eating or sleeping well, losing interest in things they used to enjoy.</li>
</ul>
<p>As a parent, avoid the urge or impulse to brush bullying off as something kids need to &#8220;tough out.&#8221; Out of fear, embarrassment, or just lack of understanding that bullying is happening, your child may deny experiencing bullying when you ask so try to initiate conversations in a roundabout way. When the child does open up stay calm, listen, and offer support and comfort. Praise the child for confiding in you and address the situation immediately with school officials. It&#8217;s important to stay on top of this situation until you&#8217;re sure it&#8217;s been fully resolved.</p>
<h2>2.  Anxiety</h2>
<p>Anxiety is a struggle that affects both adults and children of any age. It happens when a natural reaction to stress escalates to more severe levels. Children with anxiety often:</p>
<ul>
<li>Have frequent meltdowns</li>
<li>May appear agitated and restless</li>
<li>May want to avoid going to school or other places away from trusted adults</li>
<li>Have difficulty focusing</li>
<li>Complain of stomach or headaches or just not feeling well; may change eating habits</li>
<li>May have sleep problems including insomnia, nightmares, night terrors, and sleepwalking.</li>
</ul>
<p>Parents and teachers often mistake symptoms of anxiety for behavior problems. If your child has meltdowns when getting ready for school or teachers report that they&#8217;re having behavioral issues during the day, consider that anxiety may be the cause.</p>
<p>When dealing with a child who is suffering from an anxiety disorder, it&#8217;s critical to <em>really</em> listen and respond with empathy. Understand the child&#8217;s triggers and make appropriate changes to address them. Sometimes simple changes like limiting the number of after-school activities and teaching the child deep breathing exercises are enough to help ease the worst of the symptoms.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important to ensure that the child&#8217;s teachers are aware of the issue and given instructions for dealing with it. When the child&#8217;s anxiety doesn&#8217;t appear to lessen, it&#8217;s critical to seek professional advice.</p>
<h2>3. Learning Difficulties</h2>
<p>Learning disabilities can be difficult to pinpoint, as this can look very different from one child to the next.  With the new school year just starting, many children will face challenges. It&#8217;s important to monitor their academic progress and take note when things don&#8217;t seem right. Children with learning disabilities may struggle with reading, math, writing, listening, speaking, or reasoning.</p>
<p>Parents must understand that learning disabilities aren&#8217;t a problem with motivation or intelligence. These kids aren&#8217;t &#8220;lazy&#8221; or &#8220;dumb,&#8221; their brains are just wired differently. Noticing that a child is struggling and seeking help from trained specialists as early as possible are the keys to setting a learning-disabled child up for success.</p>
<h2>4.  Parental Separation</h2>
<p>When parents separate or divorce, it&#8217;s difficult for everyone involved. Children living through this transition often feel sad, lonely, stressed, and confused. Sometimes they&#8217;ll feel angry and other times they may blame themselves. Events such as field trips, parent/teacher interviews or simply birthday parties with classmates can heighten your child’s awareness of their new family dynamic.</p>
<p>Parents dealing with a separation must remember that the child&#8217;s entire world is being turned upside down and he or she is powerless to do anything about it. While the situation is always disruptive to a child’s life, parents can help reduce the child&#8217;s distress by reassuring them that the situation is not their fault and both parents will continue to remain active in their lives.</p>
<p>Make your child&#8217;s wellbeing your top priority and do your best to provide stability by providing routines, avoiding fighting in front of the child, and encouraging your child to freely express his or her feelings during this difficult time.</p>
<p>If your child is having behavior or performance problems at school, communicate with the child&#8217;s teacher and explain what&#8217;s going on at home. Although it may feel awkward, having this conversation can allow teachers to approach your child with empathy and help ensure that you&#8217;re informed about any issues right away.</p>
<h2>5.  Mental Disorders</h2>
<p>Children are prone to many mental disorders that can disrupt their day-to-day lives. This includes ADHD, obsessive-compulsive disorder, PTSD, bipolar disorder, depression, eating disorders, and more. It&#8217;s common for these issues to worsen when a child goes to school and is subject to peer pressure and group environments. The effects of the child&#8217;s condition are often mischaracterized as behavior problems.  The signs of a mental disorder vary widely depending on the type of disorder and how it manifests itself.</p>
<p>Don’t ignore changes in your child’s temperament or behavior.  Parents who think their children are affected by any of these issues should seek help from a qualified professional and communicate closely with the child&#8217;s school officials to ensure they get the help they need. Early and effective intervention gives children the best chances to overcome their challenges and become happy, healthy, and well-adjusted.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Stress</strong> is an everyday part of our lives and a normal physical and mental response to a situation where one feel’s under pressure or overwhelmed. Stress disturbs or interferes with the normal physiological equilibrium of an organism. Basically, we are out of balance.</p>
<p>In older adults, stress is thought to play a bigger role in triggering <a href="https://www.bluestoneps.com/therapy-counseling-edmonds/counseling-for-depression/">depression</a> and/or <a href="https://www.bluestoneps.com/therapy-counseling-edmonds/anxiety-and-chronic-worry-therapy/">anxiety</a> than in other age groups. Aging brings special pressures, unique life upsets and key biological changes – but they need not result in long standing psychological disorders if addressed early.</p>
<p>We all know that life is stressful. The question is how do we respond to it? Stress reduction is about shifting from reacting to responding.</p>
<p>The first step in stress management is awareness! A person needs to be able to feel and know they are experiencing stress.  Once a person is aware, mindfulness techniques and coping strategies can be done.</p>
<h2>Two quick steps to help you to come back to yourself/the present moment are:</h2>
<ol>
<li>Pause and take 3 deep breaths</li>
<li>Ask yourself the questions: “what is going on with me right now?” and “what can I do to bring myself back to the moment?”</li>
</ol>
<p>From here, you may have a couple of solutions to help you manage your immediate stress and move forward in a calmer way.</p>
<p>If you find that there is “too much” going on in your life right now, and you are feeling overwhelmed, schedule an appointment with <a href="https://www.bluestoneps.com/therapists-counselors-edmonds/terri-haaga-msw-licsw/">Terri Haaga</a> and she will be happy to assist you in developing a stress reduction plan for you or someone you care about.</p>

<h2>Do you feel more anxious today than you have in the
past?</h2>



<p>If the answer is yes, you’re not alone. </p>



<p>According to a recent study,&nbsp;Americans’ <a href="https://www.bluestoneps.com/therapy-counseling-edmonds/anxiety-and-chronic-worry-therapy/">anxiety</a> levels increased 36 percent between 2016 and 2017, and another 40 percent between 2017 and 2018! </p>



<p>When you stop and think about it, it’s really no
surprise. While modern life certainly brings many conveniences, it also creates
anxiety-producing stressors that our ancestors could never have even imagined. </p>



<p>From the “always on” world of electronics and
social media to the constant pressure to excel socially and financially, it’s
easy to feel like you just can’t catch a break. Even worse, many of these
stressors have become such a big part of our lives, we don’t even realize
they’re contributing to our feelings of unease. </p>



<p>Here are a few of modern life’s most common
stressors, and, more importantly, tips for how to deal with them.</p>



<h2><strong>The
“Always On” Mentality</strong><strong></strong></h2>



<p>Between our mobile phones, computers, and tablets,
it feels like we never get a chance to turn off. Friends, family, and employers
expect us to answer calls, emails, and text messages immediately. Failure to do
so often leads to negative repercussions. No matter what time of day or night,
it seems like there’s always something dinging, ringing, or vibrating,
demanding our attention.</p>



<p>While overcoming this is no easy task, it starts
with setting clear boundaries. Shut off automatic alerts and set a time each
morning and evening when you’ll stay completely disconnected so you can focus
on other things. Let&nbsp;people&nbsp;know that you won’t be available to
answer calls and messages right away but that you’ll get back to them at your
earliest convenience.</p>



<h2><strong>Pressure
to Put Your Best Foot Forward</strong><strong></strong></h2>



<p>It’s no secret that social media has become a huge
part of our lives. One of the problems this creates is a constant pressure to
put your best foot forward. We’re compelled to present the most perfect version
of our lives and, whether consciously or not, we’re always comparing ourselves
to the other people we follow. </p>



<p>To combat this pressure, it’s important to remember
that what you see on social media is comparable to a highlight reel. Nobody
posts about their failures, insecurities, and darkest moments, but that doesn’t
mean they don’t have them. Whenever possible, log off social media and focus
your energy on enjoying your life in the real world. </p>



<h2><strong>Striving
for the Perfect “Mini-Me”</strong><strong></strong></h2>



<p>Raising kids has never been easy, but there’s more pressure now than ever for them to excel in academics, sports, and extracurricular activities. Not only will this constant push for achievement stress you out, but it can also impact your <a href="https://www.bluestoneps.com/therapy-counseling-edmonds/child-and-family-therapy/">child’s mental health</a>.</p>



<p>To minimize anxiety for everyone in the household,
limit the number of activities your children participate in at one time. Give
them plenty of opportunities to relax and play and make sure they have ample
time to devote to their schoolwork. If your child is struggling, work with them
to find the cause rather than adding more pressure. </p>



<p>Above all, remember that other people&#8217;s opinions of
your children don&#8217;t matter. No one should expect your children to be great at
everything. As long as they&#8217;re trying their best, do everyone a favor and cut
them (and you!) some slack.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Trying
to Buy Happiness</strong><strong></strong></h2>



<p>Nothing robs us of our happiness more than the
inability to feel satisfied with what we’ve got. For many, a high standard of
living is the norm. While on the surface your lifestyle may seem perfect, the
constant hustle needed to pay for all of life’s luxuries creates unnecessary
stress. Even worse, working all the time prevents us from enjoying what life is
really all about. </p>



<p>Instead of worrying about making enough money to
afford your next luxury vacation or that designer handbag, try focusing on
creating a more minimal lifestyle. Once you begin enjoying your life as it is,
you’ll wish you had done it sooner. </p>



<h2><strong>Fear-Mongering
Media </strong><strong></strong></h2>



<p>It seems like you can’t turn on the television or
the radio without getting an earful of doom and gloom. While some would argue
that it’s important to have an idea of what’s happening in the news, for many,
an overabundance of news causes an avalanche of emotions tied to things over
which we have little to no control. </p>



<p>You can help combat this by consciously limiting
your exposure to news media. Read the headlines or listen to the news in the
morning, then disconnect from it for the rest of the day. If something really
interests you, look into it the next morning&nbsp;instead of letting updates
distract you all afternoon and evening. This way, you&#8217;ll still have some
knowledge of what&#8217;s going on around you without allowing it to ruin your entire
day.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Some
Final Thoughts </strong><strong></strong></h2>



<p>It&#8217;s no surprise that our modern lives bring us
anxiety. Learning how to effectively deal with everyday stressors is the first
step towards&nbsp;creating a calm and happy life. Try out a few of these tips
and see how you feel. Sometimes, even a small change can make a big difference!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>June</strong> is LGBTQ+ pride month in Seattle! We thought we would show our pride by highlighting some principles that we have learned from the LGBTQ+ community. At the end of the day, we are all here to achieve lives that are more hopeful and fulfilling, regardless of who we are or where we come from. <br></p>



<span id="more-2963"></span>



<h2><strong>Be Brave</strong> </h2>



<p>Change has never been easy. Many strides have been made in the LGBTQ+ community over the last decade, but no one said it was without sacrifice. It’s important that we face our fears and persevere in our journeys in order to achieve justice and equality. Living courageously means acknowledging the challenges and our fears and choosing to pursue our visions anyway.</p>



<h2><strong>Better Together</strong></h2>



<p>It’s important that we all have people around us who support us and people who understand or care about what we are going through. Share experiences and learn new things with people you enjoy being around in order to build a community and strong support system. </p>



<h2><strong>Have Pride</strong> </h2>



<p>It’s important to celebrate who you are, being authentic and honest with yourself and others. Constantly adjusting for others can be exhausting and lead to depression, anxiety, poor confidence and self-esteem. </p>



<h2><strong>Respect the Journey</strong></h2>



<p>While some of us have similar themes in our personal stories, each person has their own separate journey. It’s okay to have different experiences than your peers, or to process similar experiences differently. What’s important is that you exercise compassion, acknowledging that each of us is a human with our own unique thoughts, feelings, shortcomings, and achievements. This compassion extends to ourselves as individuals. &nbsp;</p>
