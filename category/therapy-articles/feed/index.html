				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You may be wondering if or when the Charmd offices will begin offering in-person appointments again and what we are doing to keep everyone as safe as possible. While we cannot guarantee that there is no risk of exposure to COVID-19 within our office spaces, we can follow recommended guidelines as much as possible and make collaborative decisions with you about your care. Our latest newsletter outlined some of the details we consider when making the decision to re-open and welcome staff as well as clients back into our office spaces. It is not a simple decision to make and so each therapist will make his or her own choices while considering their own health status and risk, the health status and risk of their clients, and what is most clinically appropriate for each individual client.</p>
<p>This brief video will give you an idea of what we are doing as well as what to expect if you do come in for an appointment. Following the CDC and state guidelines as well as the guidelines from our professional organizations, our primary recommendation continues to be to receive your care via <a href="https://www.bluestoneps.com/telehealth-counseling/">telehealth.</a> You are welcome to bring any questions to your therapist.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello Charmd Connections Readers!</p>
<p>We are thinking of you all during this challenging time and hoping you and your loved ones are doing well. There are some of you whom we haven’t seen in a while because the initial stay home order was only set to last for 15 days so it didn’t seem like a big deal to wait. Now, however, you may find the stress we are all living with is beginning to grow and take its toll. This may be especially true now that the duration of our required social distancing is extended through April and the news about COVID-19 is not actually getting better or more reassuring.</p>
<p>As we settle into our new normal, I encourage you to consider your self-care more strongly than ever. This is not a sprint but a long-distance event that you will need stamina for to get through. With telehealth being easier to get now, and many insurance companies waiving some consumer’s costs (waived copays, for example, with some insurers), <strong>this is a great time to get started on your journey toward emotional wellness through <a href="https://www.bluestoneps.com/telehealth-counseling/">video counseling</a>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Here are some ideas to keep yourself strong:</strong></p>
<h2>1. Exercise, exercise, exercise!</h2>
<p>It’s clear that since COVID-19, we are moving less and missing out on reducing biochemical stress (being more sedentary delays the release of cortisol and other biological consequences of stress) as well as biomechanical stress (with decreased activity our muscles aren’t releasing physiological tension). We are also missing the opportunity of building the feel-good hormones and maintaining a felt sense of balance and strength in our bodies and the improved cognitive clarity and focus that come with exercise.</p>
<p>There are many ways to exercise even while social distancing:</p>
<p>a. Fortunately, Spring is on its way. Being out of doors can actually be a relief now! It’s a prefect time to get to the walking, running, or biking you’ve been thinking about.</p>
<p>b. Check out your gym’s or studio’s webpage and see if they are live streaming any of their classes.</p>
<p>c. There are a ton of apps and videos available that you can try out – many have free trial periods or are free all the time.</p>
<p>d. Make it fun for the whole family – each family member can take turns finding a free exercise session on YouTube and everyone can do it together. Break into teams, each learning a dance routine and then have a dance off. Create a family Olympics where everyone decides what they want to work on and what their personal best goal is – and then cheer each other on!</p>
<h2>2. Develop a spiritual/contemplative practice.</h2>
<p>We often think this would be a good idea, hear that it is something we “should” do. With more time at home, this could be a perfect opportunity to:</p>
<p>a. Download that inspiring book you’ve always wanted to read from a book store or the library.</p>
<p>b. Watch a movie or Ted Talk that gets you thinking about deeper/bigger things rather than encourages you tune out.</p>
<p>c. Download that meditation app your friend told you about ages ago and give it a try.</p>
<p>d. Ever have a church or other place you thought looked interesting but never had the time to actually go to? Many are now live streaming their lectures/services from their websites and/or social media. It’s a perfect time to check them out!</p>
<p>e. Try journaling – if nothing else, this is a very strange time of constricted movement, changed work/school environment and habits, a major pandemic, and more. There’s certainly more to reflect on and write about!</p>
<h2>3. Take COVID-19 breaks.</h2>
<p>I cannot emphasize this enough! The news about C-19 is constant and yet, relatively little of it is giving us new information. It’s typically report after report about the strain on our medical facilities, risks to medical personnel, threats to our wellbeing, news of increasing numbers of cases and deaths, borders closing and restricted travel around the world, what the latest expert says or politician is or isn’t doing. All the fear and negativity wreaks havoc on our emotions and our bodies.</p>
<p>Here are some ideas to take a break from it all:</p>
<p>a. Decide on one or two news sources you trust and want to follow and then only check in on them once or twice a day for a set amount of time each.</p>
<p>b. Take up gardening. Even if all you have is a tiny balcony, you can start growing vegetable and flower starts to move into a bigger pot as the season progresses. For those with bigger yard space, there’s certainly plenty of Spring clean up to be done now. Maybe this is the year to build that special patio to relax on or rethink a part of your garden beds. You can start preparing those spaces now. You can try growing things from seed, try propagating from plants you already have.</p>
<p>c. There are many “normal” things happening right now too. Make it a point to look for those, notice them, feel them in your body. Is there a favorite tree that is beginning to bloom again? Are you noticing how much longer day light is with us now? Are there certain birds that are coming back to visit the new flowers and berries around you. Take the time to observe and feel it in your body.</p>
<p>d. Get inspired by art and beauty and share it with those important to you:</p>
<p>i. Create new playlists that support your emotional wellbeing.</p>
<p>ii. Find photographs, pieces of art, poems, dance performances, anything that help you express what is in your heart, focusing on gratitude, love, hope.</p>
<p>These are unprecedented times. My grandparents talked about the Great Depression. Relatives talked about living through WWII. My generation had 9-11. Our young people will talk about living through the COVID-19 pandemic. It’s longer term impact on our culture has yet to be seen. While we’re in this part of the experience, there are a number of choices we can make to care for ourselves and to keep our mental, emotional and physical selves strong.</p>
<p><strong>If there is anything we can do for you, please do not hesitate to reach out.</strong> Appointment times are available for new and returning clients. If you’re concerned that having a counseling appointment by video would feel strange or be complicated, please reach out. We would be happy to walk you through the process, including a free 10 minute practice run through so you can learn just how easy it is. <a href="https://www.bluestoneps.com/telehealth-counseling/">Click here</a> for more information about telehealth.</p>
<p>And, in the midst of all this, we are excited to announce a new addition to our panel of therapists. <a href="https://www.bluestoneps.com/therapists-counselors-edmonds/sara-magdaleno-msw-licsw/">Sara Magdaleno, MSW, LICSW</a> brings her talents and interest in working with clients aged 12 through adult to our office. See below for more information.</p>
<p>Take care and be well!</p>

<h2>Do you feel more anxious today than you have in the
past?</h2>



<p>If the answer is yes, you’re not alone. </p>



<p>According to a recent study,&nbsp;Americans’ <a href="https://www.bluestoneps.com/therapy-counseling-edmonds/anxiety-and-chronic-worry-therapy/">anxiety</a> levels increased 36 percent between 2016 and 2017, and another 40 percent between 2017 and 2018! </p>



<p>When you stop and think about it, it’s really no
surprise. While modern life certainly brings many conveniences, it also creates
anxiety-producing stressors that our ancestors could never have even imagined. </p>



<p>From the “always on” world of electronics and
social media to the constant pressure to excel socially and financially, it’s
easy to feel like you just can’t catch a break. Even worse, many of these
stressors have become such a big part of our lives, we don’t even realize
they’re contributing to our feelings of unease. </p>



<p>Here are a few of modern life’s most common
stressors, and, more importantly, tips for how to deal with them.</p>



<h2><strong>The
“Always On” Mentality</strong><strong></strong></h2>



<p>Between our mobile phones, computers, and tablets,
it feels like we never get a chance to turn off. Friends, family, and employers
expect us to answer calls, emails, and text messages immediately. Failure to do
so often leads to negative repercussions. No matter what time of day or night,
it seems like there’s always something dinging, ringing, or vibrating,
demanding our attention.</p>



<p>While overcoming this is no easy task, it starts
with setting clear boundaries. Shut off automatic alerts and set a time each
morning and evening when you’ll stay completely disconnected so you can focus
on other things. Let&nbsp;people&nbsp;know that you won’t be available to
answer calls and messages right away but that you’ll get back to them at your
earliest convenience.</p>



<h2><strong>Pressure
to Put Your Best Foot Forward</strong><strong></strong></h2>



<p>It’s no secret that social media has become a huge
part of our lives. One of the problems this creates is a constant pressure to
put your best foot forward. We’re compelled to present the most perfect version
of our lives and, whether consciously or not, we’re always comparing ourselves
to the other people we follow. </p>



<p>To combat this pressure, it’s important to remember
that what you see on social media is comparable to a highlight reel. Nobody
posts about their failures, insecurities, and darkest moments, but that doesn’t
mean they don’t have them. Whenever possible, log off social media and focus
your energy on enjoying your life in the real world. </p>



<h2><strong>Striving
for the Perfect “Mini-Me”</strong><strong></strong></h2>



<p>Raising kids has never been easy, but there’s more pressure now than ever for them to excel in academics, sports, and extracurricular activities. Not only will this constant push for achievement stress you out, but it can also impact your <a href="https://www.bluestoneps.com/therapy-counseling-edmonds/child-and-family-therapy/">child’s mental health</a>.</p>



<p>To minimize anxiety for everyone in the household,
limit the number of activities your children participate in at one time. Give
them plenty of opportunities to relax and play and make sure they have ample
time to devote to their schoolwork. If your child is struggling, work with them
to find the cause rather than adding more pressure. </p>



<p>Above all, remember that other people&#8217;s opinions of
your children don&#8217;t matter. No one should expect your children to be great at
everything. As long as they&#8217;re trying their best, do everyone a favor and cut
them (and you!) some slack.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Trying
to Buy Happiness</strong><strong></strong></h2>



<p>Nothing robs us of our happiness more than the
inability to feel satisfied with what we’ve got. For many, a high standard of
living is the norm. While on the surface your lifestyle may seem perfect, the
constant hustle needed to pay for all of life’s luxuries creates unnecessary
stress. Even worse, working all the time prevents us from enjoying what life is
really all about. </p>



<p>Instead of worrying about making enough money to
afford your next luxury vacation or that designer handbag, try focusing on
creating a more minimal lifestyle. Once you begin enjoying your life as it is,
you’ll wish you had done it sooner. </p>



<h2><strong>Fear-Mongering
Media </strong><strong></strong></h2>



<p>It seems like you can’t turn on the television or
the radio without getting an earful of doom and gloom. While some would argue
that it’s important to have an idea of what’s happening in the news, for many,
an overabundance of news causes an avalanche of emotions tied to things over
which we have little to no control. </p>



<p>You can help combat this by consciously limiting
your exposure to news media. Read the headlines or listen to the news in the
morning, then disconnect from it for the rest of the day. If something really
interests you, look into it the next morning&nbsp;instead of letting updates
distract you all afternoon and evening. This way, you&#8217;ll still have some
knowledge of what&#8217;s going on around you without allowing it to ruin your entire
day.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Some
Final Thoughts </strong><strong></strong></h2>



<p>It&#8217;s no surprise that our modern lives bring us
anxiety. Learning how to effectively deal with everyday stressors is the first
step towards&nbsp;creating a calm and happy life. Try out a few of these tips
and see how you feel. Sometimes, even a small change can make a big difference!</p>

		<title>5 Things we can Learn from the LGBTQ+ Community</title>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>June</strong> is LGBTQ+ pride month in Seattle! We thought we would show our pride by highlighting some principles that we have learned from the LGBTQ+ community. At the end of the day, we are all here to achieve lives that are more hopeful and fulfilling, regardless of who we are or where we come from. <br></p>



<span id="more-2963"></span>



<h2><strong>Be Brave</strong> </h2>



<p>Change has never been easy. Many strides have been made in the LGBTQ+ community over the last decade, but no one said it was without sacrifice. It’s important that we face our fears and persevere in our journeys in order to achieve justice and equality. Living courageously means acknowledging the challenges and our fears and choosing to pursue our visions anyway.</p>



<h2><strong>Better Together</strong></h2>



<p>It’s important that we all have people around us who support us and people who understand or care about what we are going through. Share experiences and learn new things with people you enjoy being around in order to build a community and strong support system. </p>



<h2><strong>Have Pride</strong> </h2>



<p>It’s important to celebrate who you are, being authentic and honest with yourself and others. Constantly adjusting for others can be exhausting and lead to depression, anxiety, poor confidence and self-esteem. </p>



<h2><strong>Respect the Journey</strong></h2>



<p>While some of us have similar themes in our personal stories, each person has their own separate journey. It’s okay to have different experiences than your peers, or to process similar experiences differently. What’s important is that you exercise compassion, acknowledging that each of us is a human with our own unique thoughts, feelings, shortcomings, and achievements. This compassion extends to ourselves as individuals. &nbsp;</p>

<h2>God grant me the Serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference.</h2>



<p>Often
associated with AA, this prayer can be <strong>helpful
for anyone,</strong> not just those in recovery from addiction. Its teaching is
directed toward helping people reduce their desire to control things they
cannot and find the balance between acceptance and change. </p>



<span id="more-2838"></span>



<p><strong>Accepting the universal truth that we
can’t control everything is difficult for most humans.</strong> Culturally, we even
endorse the notion that we can control things:</p>



<ul><li>We tell our children they can be whatever they want to be,
when that’s actually not true. We are not all the same, with the same
intellectual or physical abilities. We each have our unique gifts and abilities
and some ideas we have about what we want to do in our lives will be a good fit
with our gifts and some won’t. </li><li>We are taught, if we want it badly enough and work hard
enough for it, we can have whatever we want. This is also not true. We can’t
control how another person feels about us, the choices they ultimately make. We
can try to influence things, but we can’t control them when another person is
involved, no matter how badly we want it or work at it. Maybe we’ll get that
job and maybe we won’t. Maybe our partner will decide to stay with us and maybe
not.</li></ul>



<p>We
can all struggle with knowing the difference between what we can and can’t
control and struggle with recognizing the difference between the two when they
appear in our lives.&nbsp; Accepting and being
at peace with the idea we can’t control everything and being able to focus on
what we can change is a lifelong journey.</p>



<h2><strong>DON’T GET HUNG UP ON LANGUAGE AND MISS OUT ON THE WISDOM OF
THIS TEACHING </strong></h2>



<p>There
are words in this teaching that can be difficult for some and so they dismiss
it. Words like “prayer” and “God” have clear religious connotations and can
trigger negative memories, associations and emotions for some. If this is true
for you, <strong>these are things you can
control so change them and make it yours.</strong></p>



<p>If
“God” is not a word or concept that brings you comfort or that means anything
to you, change it. Rather than ‘praying to God,’ you might begin: “May I find
the Serenity”, “May I build/grow/create the Serenity”, “May I find peace in
accepting”, or other such variations.</p>



<p>If
the word “Prayer” is a barrier for you, change it. Words like “poem”, “mantra”
and “meditation” work just as well.</p>



<p>The
point of this prayer/mantra is to give you a tool to help remind you of this
universal truth, to help you reset when you become upset by something, and to
help encourage you to go forward in creating the best life you can, even when
it’s uncomfortable or scary. </p>

<p>Work problems, going away to school, an illness — any
number of life changes can cause stress. Most of the time, people adjust to
such changes within a few months. But if you continue to feel down or

<p>Work problems, going away to school, an illness — any
number of life changes can cause stress. Most of the time, people adjust to
such changes within a few months. But if you continue to feel down or
self-destructive, you may have an adjustment disorder.</p>



<span id="more-2731"></span>



<p>An adjustment disorder is a type of stress-related mental illness. You may <a href="https://www.bluestoneps.com/therapy-counseling-edmonds/anxiety-and-chronic-worry-therapy/">feel anxious</a> or <a href="https://www.bluestoneps.com/therapy-counseling-edmonds/counseling-for-depression/">depressed</a>, or even have thoughts of suicide. Your normal daily routines may feel overwhelming. Or you may make reckless decisions. In essence, you have a hard time adjusting to change in your life, and it has serious consequences.</p>



<p>You don&#8217;t have to tough it out on your own, though.
Adjustment disorder treatment — usually brief — is likely to help you regain
your emotional footing.</p>



<p>Adjustment disorders symptoms vary
from person to person. The symptoms you have may be different from those of
someone else with an adjustment disorder. But for everyone, symptoms of an
adjustment disorder begin within three months of a stressful event in your
life.</p>



<p><strong>Emotional
symptoms of adjustment disorders</strong></p>



<p>Signs and symptoms of adjustment
disorder may affect how you feel and think about yourself or life, including:</p>



<ul><li>Sadness</li><li>Hopelessness</li><li>Lack of enjoyment</li><li>Crying spells</li><li>Nervousness</li><li>Jitteriness</li><li>Anxiety, which may include separation anxiety</li><li>Worry</li><li>Desperation</li><li>Trouble sleeping</li><li>Difficulty concentrating</li><li>Feeling overwhelmed</li><li>Thoughts of suicide</li></ul>



<p><strong>Behavioral
symptoms of adjustment disorders</strong></p>



<p>Signs and symptoms of adjustment
disorder may affect your actions or behavior, such as:</p>



<ul><li>Fighting</li><li>Reckless driving</li><li>Ignoring bills</li><li>Avoiding family or friends</li><li>Performing poorly in school or at work</li><li>Skipping school</li><li>Vandalizing property</li></ul>



<p><strong>Length
of symptoms</strong></p>



<p>How long you have symptoms of an
adjustment disorder also can vary:</p>



<ul><li><strong>6 months or less (acute).</strong> In these cases, symptoms should ease once the stressor is removed. Brief professional treatment may help symptoms disappear.</li><li><strong>More than 6 months (chronic).</strong> In these cases, symptoms continue to bother you and disrupt your life. Professional treatment may help symptoms improve and prevent the condition from continuing to get worse.</li></ul>



<p><strong>When
to see a doctor</strong></p>



<p>Sometimes the stressful change in
your life goes away, and your symptoms of adjustment disorder get better
because the stress has eased. But often, the stressful event remains a part of
your life. Or a new stressful situation comes up, and you face the same
emotional struggles all over again.</p>



<p>Talk to your doctor if you&#8217;re having
trouble getting through each day. You can get treatment to help you cope better
with stressful events and feel better about life again.</p>



<p><strong>If
you have suicidal thoughts</strong></p>



<p>If you or someone you know has
thoughts of suicide, get help right away. Consider talking to your doctor,
nurse, a mental health professional, a trusted family member or friend, or your
faith leader.</p>



<p>If you think you may hurt yourself
or attempt suicide, call 911 or your local emergency number immediately. Or
call a suicide hot line number. In the United States, you can call the 24-hour
National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 800-273-8255 (toll-free) to talk with a
trained counselor.</p>



<p>Researchers are still trying to figure out
what causes adjustment disorders. As with other mental disorders, the cause is
likely complex and may involve genetics, your life experiences, your
temperament and even changes in the natural chemicals in the brain.</p>



<p>Although the cause of adjustment
disorders is unknown, some things make you more likely to have an adjustment
disorder. Among children and teenagers, both boys and girls have about the same
chance of having adjustment disorders. Among adults, women are twice as likely
to be diagnosed with adjustment disorders.</p>



<p><strong>Stressful
events</strong></p>



<p>One or more stressful life events
may put you at risk of developing an adjustment disorder. It may involve almost
any type of stressful event in your life. Both positive and negative events can
cause extreme stress. Some common examples include:</p>



<ul><li>Being diagnosed with a serious illness</li><li>Problems in school</li><li>Divorce or relationship breakup</li><li>Job loss</li><li>Having a baby</li><li>Financial problems</li><li>Physical assault</li><li>Surviving a disaster</li><li>Retirement</li><li>Death of a loved one</li><li>Going away to school</li></ul>



<p>In some cases, people who face an
ongoing stressful situation — such as living in a crime-ridden neighborhood —
can reach a breaking point and develop an adjustment disorder.</p>



<p><strong>Your
life experiences</strong></p>



<p>If you generally don&#8217;t cope well
with change or you don&#8217;t have a strong support system, you may be more likely
to have an extreme reaction to a stressful event.</p>



<p>Your risk of an adjustment disorder
may be higher if you experienced stress in early childhood. Overprotective or
abusive parenting, family disruptions, and frequent moves early in life may
make you feel like you&#8217;re unable to control events in your life. When difficulties
then arise, you may have trouble coping.</p>



<p>Other risk factors may include:</p>



<ul><li>Other mental health problems</li><li>Exposure to wars or violence</li><li>Difficult life circumstances</li></ul>



<p>Most adults with adjustment disorder
get better within six months and don&#8217;t have long-term complications. However,
people who also have another mental health disorder, a substance abuse problem
or a chronic adjustment disorder are more likely to have long-term mental
health problems, which may include:</p>

<p>When we hear about PTSD, it is often in the context of
military veterans returning from active duty or victims of assault. People can
discount their experiences as ‘not being <em>that</em>
bad’ and feel like they couldn’t have been traumatized. I have heard more than
once, ‘Well I wasn’t [fill in the blank with a recent news story] when I was a
kid so what I went through wasn’t that bad. I should be able to just get over
it and move on. It was a long time ago.’ Or, ‘I wasn’t injured in the car
accident; it wasn’t that bad. I shouldn’t be having these problems
driving.’&nbsp; </p>



<span id="more-2634"></span>



<p>People can be really hard on themselves for not being
immune to the impact of an event that was a shock to them physically and
emotionally. I hope to answer some questions about PTSD and why, sometimes, we
can’t just ‘get over it.’</p>



<h2><strong>What&nbsp;is&nbsp;PTSD?</strong></h2>



<p>Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a mental health
condition that&#8217;s triggered by a terrifying event — either experiencing it or
witnessing it. The event may have been an isolated occurrence (like a car
accident) or it may be something that went on for a prolonged period of time
(as is often the case in abuse during childhood). Symptoms may include
flashbacks (feeling like you are back in the event), nightmares and severe
anxiety, a generalized lack of trust, as well as intrusive thoughts about the
event that you can’t make go away. </p>



<p>When someone goes through a traumatic event, it is a shock
to the person physically, emotionally, developmentally, and often spiritually.
Sometimes, people who go through traumatic events, especially isolated or
shorter-term events, have difficulty adjusting and coping for a while, but they
don&#8217;t develop PTSD.&nbsp; In the case of an
isolated event like an accident, time stops in an unanticipated way that one
couldn’t possibly have prepared for. It requires you to adjust and accommodate
the disruption and sometimes derailment of your plans, how you see yourself and
the world and your usual way of going through your life. This is not always an
easy process, and with time, good self-care, and compassionate support from
others, some people find their symptoms improve on their own. But this is not
true for everyone. </p>



<p>In the case of ongoing trauma, the person is again affected physically, emotionally, developmentally, and often spiritually. One of the differences, however, is that the person cannot get away from the <a href="https://www.bluestoneps.com/therapy-counseling-edmonds/trauma-therapy-and-post-traumatic-stress-disorder/">trauma</a>. It’s like having a car accident nearly all day every day for weeks, months or years. Even more difficult is being a child abused by a trusted family member; the very person who is supposed to keep you safe is the source of your abuse. Studies show that living through such events actually alters the development of your brain and your neurology. It also requires you to create coping skills, behaviors and belief systems that enable you to survive a system you can’t get out of until you’re grown. Unfortunately many survivors suffer ongoing symptoms as they continue to use the same skills, behaviors and belief systems even when they are on their own. To change these things, they need to go through a healing process.</p>



<p>Getting effective treatment after PTSD symptoms develop can
be critical to reduce symptoms and help you return to or create a more
satisfying life. The best news is people do recover! If your symptoms get worse
rather than better or if you survived longer term abuse but are still
experiencing difficulties from it, you can get help.</p>

<p>We all know we <em>should</em>
exercise for our physical, mental and emotional health. But what if we really
don’t enjoy it? For those of us who are not innately thrilled to be going to
the gym and working out on the weight machines or cardio machines to nowhere, following
through on our exercise goals can be the most difficult part of keeping a
healthy living routine. This is especially true during the many months of cold,
rainy weather in the Northwest.&nbsp; Here are
a couple tips to support you in your goals toward healthy living:</p>



<span id="more-2594"></span>



<h2><strong>1. Don’t
focus on how much you don’t want to do it: </strong></h2>



<p>Once there you may be able to get into your workout
and not mind it so much. A client told me if she can walk for at least 24
minutes, she’ll make her 60 minutes goal. She doesn’t know why this turning
point happens at that time, but knowing that it’s there, helps her persist in
going for the walk and staying at it long enough to reach the good feeling.
Another client used the sensation of diving into the pool as her carrot to get
there. She confessed she never actually wanted to go to the pool, but by
focusing on the sensations of entering the water, which was her favorite part,
she was able to get herself there consistently.</p>



<p>In addition, keep in mind that the feeling of
accomplishment and better energy and mood after the workout can even make you
glad you went. Think about how your self-esteem will strengthen saying, ‘today
I did that’ rather than feeling sheepish and upset with yourself for not going.
Endless studies support the boost in mood and energy as well as improved sleep
that result from exercise. Your stress level will come down and your patience
will go up. </p>



<p>Rather than focusing your thoughts on how you should
go exercise and on how much you don’t want to go,<strong> focus on feeling good once you’re there and on how good you’ll feel
afterward. </strong></p>



<h2><strong>2. Figure
out what will inspire or energize you while you’re exercising:</strong></h2>



<p>Nothing is worse than walking on a treadmill facing a
wall or running the same route over and over again. What will help you feel
good while you’re exercising? Is it a podcast? A certain music playlist? A book
you never seem to get to? A movie you want to watch on some device while using
a machine? Is there someone who will go with you sometimes? A team you can
join/create to share the different legs of a triathlon? A goal, like you’re
first 5K?</p>



<p>It’s easy to get in a rut and have your program feel
boring. <strong>Try different things, be
creative and mix it up.</strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The end of the year holidays often bring a mixture of emotions for people. Excitement, hope and joy are all emotions we may experience as we look forward to seeing people we haven’t seen in a while, return to places we are connected to, and think of gifts to give to loved ones. The holidays bring unique experiences we wait all year for like baking special breads and preparing special foods, listening to music and singing songs unique to this time of year, decorating our homes with special lighting and meaningful items. The kids have an extended time out of school and those who are away often come home, vacations are planned and enjoyed. As a year is coming to an end, it’s also often a time for reflection and planning for the new year. </p>



<span id="more-2283"></span>


<p>With so much going on, this can also be a time for sadness, disappointment, and stress. Perhaps this is the first holiday without a loved one. Seeing the empty place at the table or thinking of getting through the new year without someone to celebrate with can be painful. Homecomings can be fraught with tension and distress as old, unhealed hurts are poked again. Perhaps finances are tighter than before.</p>
<p>There is a lot of pressure at this time of year to produce something: post excellent year end numbers for work; present a model like appearance for a party; create an amazing holiday party; send out the perfect family holiday card; make sure each side of your family feels equally attended to. Beginning before Thanksgiving now there are constant messages to spend money and look happy. Whether the holiday season has a religious focus for you or not, we are bombarded by messages about making others happy through spending. <strong>Getting through this time of year with grace and ease is possible. </strong></p>
<p>Beyond the religious element, there are many opportunities that come through the fall and winter. As the days get shorter, colder, darker, wetter, and grayer, we spend more time in doors. This offers us the opportunity to slow down and in slowing down, an opportunity to reflect and appreciate. Beginning with Thanksgiving, it’s a time to think about all those things you are grateful for: loved ones and friendship, health, community, purpose, activities you enjoy, and so much more. It doesn’t mean everything in your life or the world is perfect. It doesn’t mean denying that there isn’t much pain and injustice around us. It means that these good things are also true and it’s important to honor them as well. <strong>Spending time focusing on the good things in your life, even if the list seems filled with inconsequential things, will help cultivate a positive mood and a sense of calm.</strong></p>
<p>As you spend less time out doing things, you are also presented with a great opportunity to reflect on your year and assess where you are in your life. Again, you may not be exactly where you thought you’d be or where you think you ought to be, but acknowledge those things you have learned, begun, or accomplished in the last year. And then you can begin thinking about where you would like to take your life in the upcoming year and ponder how you might achieve those goals. Remember to include lighthearted and fun goals as well. Cooking class? New garden bed design for your yard? Dance class? A travel adventure?<strong><a href="https://www.bluestoneps.com/preparing-for-those-new-years-resolutions/"> See our blog post about SMART goal setting to stack the success cards in your favor</a>.</strong> Again, creating a balance of goals that are challenging and goals that are fun will keep your life interesting and engaging.</p>
<p>Even if this is not a religious holiday for you, you can take a que from its celebratory nature. With all the gloomy dark and dampness, how do you want to make your home feel cozy? How do you want to acknowledge those who are most important to you with a joyous activity or meal? How might you cultivate a spirit of giving and generosity that will extend beyond the holidays? <strong>Have you taken time to examine and honor transformative moments in your life? </strong>What was it about those moments or about those people who came into your life that inspired you to see yourself differently and influenced the trajectory of your life? Take time to reflect on the learning and gifts of those moments/people and how you can continue to honor them and build on them in the upcoming year.</p>
<p>While your mood and energy levels may be influenced by the fall, winter and early spring weather in the Pacific Northwest and you may struggle with endless bombardment of commercials and holiday music, there are ways to bring your own take on the opportunities presented during this time. Intentionally engaging in those things that are meaningful to you, keeping realistic expectations about how various events will go, and balancing challenging things with joyous things will help you experience both ease and grace in your life. Enjoy!</p>]]></content:encoded>
