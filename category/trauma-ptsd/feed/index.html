<p>When we hear about PTSD, it is often in the context of
military veterans returning from active duty or victims of assault. People can
discount their experiences as ‘not being <em>that</em>
bad’ and feel like they couldn’t have been traumatized. I have heard more than
once, ‘Well I wasn’t [fill in the blank with a recent news story] when I was a
kid so what I went through wasn’t that bad. I should be able to just get over
it and move on. It was a long time ago.’ Or, ‘I wasn’t injured in the car
accident; it wasn’t that bad. I shouldn’t be having these problems
driving.’&nbsp; </p>



<span id="more-2634"></span>



<p>People can be really hard on themselves for not being
immune to the impact of an event that was a shock to them physically and
emotionally. I hope to answer some questions about PTSD and why, sometimes, we
can’t just ‘get over it.’</p>



<h2><strong>What&nbsp;is&nbsp;PTSD?</strong></h2>



<p>Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a mental health
condition that&#8217;s triggered by a terrifying event — either experiencing it or
witnessing it. The event may have been an isolated occurrence (like a car
accident) or it may be something that went on for a prolonged period of time
(as is often the case in abuse during childhood). Symptoms may include
flashbacks (feeling like you are back in the event), nightmares and severe
anxiety, a generalized lack of trust, as well as intrusive thoughts about the
event that you can’t make go away. </p>



<p>When someone goes through a traumatic event, it is a shock
to the person physically, emotionally, developmentally, and often spiritually.
Sometimes, people who go through traumatic events, especially isolated or
shorter-term events, have difficulty adjusting and coping for a while, but they
don&#8217;t develop PTSD.&nbsp; In the case of an
isolated event like an accident, time stops in an unanticipated way that one
couldn’t possibly have prepared for. It requires you to adjust and accommodate
the disruption and sometimes derailment of your plans, how you see yourself and
the world and your usual way of going through your life. This is not always an
easy process, and with time, good self-care, and compassionate support from
others, some people find their symptoms improve on their own. But this is not
true for everyone. </p>



<p>In the case of ongoing trauma, the person is again affected physically, emotionally, developmentally, and often spiritually. One of the differences, however, is that the person cannot get away from the <a href="https://www.bluestoneps.com/therapy-counseling-edmonds/trauma-therapy-and-post-traumatic-stress-disorder/">trauma</a>. It’s like having a car accident nearly all day every day for weeks, months or years. Even more difficult is being a child abused by a trusted family member; the very person who is supposed to keep you safe is the source of your abuse. Studies show that living through such events actually alters the development of your brain and your neurology. It also requires you to create coping skills, behaviors and belief systems that enable you to survive a system you can’t get out of until you’re grown. Unfortunately many survivors suffer ongoing symptoms as they continue to use the same skills, behaviors and belief systems even when they are on their own. To change these things, they need to go through a healing process.</p>



<p>Getting effective treatment after PTSD symptoms develop can
be critical to reduce symptoms and help you return to or create a more
satisfying life. The best news is people do recover! If your symptoms get worse
rather than better or if you survived longer term abuse but are still
experiencing difficulties from it, you can get help.</p>

<p>Our minds are delicate things. Traumatic events cause not only physical injury, but their effects on our minds are often just as severe, and much harder to recover from. Here are some of the steps you need to take for emotional and psychological recovery after such incidents: </p>



<span id="more-1449"></span>


<h2><strong><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">Confront the Issue</span></strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">The mental trauma you experience may have been brought upon by any number of factors. It may be something that happened a long time ago. It may have happened recently. You may been subjected to physical injury or mental torture. Whatever the cause, the first step towards recovery is accepting that you have a problem.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">There are many symptoms of mental stress you need to be aware of. You may find yourself developing irrational mood swings or going into a state of depression. You may experience feelings of guilt or thoughts of self-harm. Your body might respond to ordinary events with an increased heartbeat, sweating or panic attacks. Keep track of all these symptoms and try to deduce which traumatic event from your past may have triggered them.</span></p>
<h2><strong><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">Seek Trauma Therapy</span></strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">Your mind is incredibly complex, and trying to cure it on your own can result in futile or even disastrous results. Buying medicine without a prescription can result in drug abuse and dependency. Thinking the problem will go away or lessen over time is also not healthy. Neither is going online to search for answers on chat forums, since the internet plays host to a vast amount of misinformation and untruths.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">Seeking the help of a professional is sometimes considered shameful or unnecessary, but remember that just like doctors are trained to treat the body, psychologists are trained to treat minds. They are there to help, but you need to take the first step by seeking them out.</span></p>
<h2><strong><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">Exercise for Psychological Relief</span></strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">Trauma affects your nervous system by lowering endorphin levels and pumping out chemicals which promote hyper-arousal and fear. The best way to fight this reaction is by forcing your body to take part in some vigorous, but non-dangerous exercise. Your body will slowly return to a state of normalcy, and you will be subjected to fresh endorphins which will help bring down anxiety levels. </span></p>
<h2><strong><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">Connect with Loved Ones</span></strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">We all have people in our lives who we are close to, and who value us. Get in touch with those people and spend time with them on normal things. Go see a movie, take part in some group activity or just stay at home to watch TV. The aim is to return to a feeling of normalcy after the traumatic experience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">If it appears your psychological problems will require professional trauma therapy, don&#8217;t try to hide the fact from your friends. Take them into your confidence, and they will help you adjust to your new reality. They can drop you off at the therapist&#8217;s office, go with you for appointments and generally be your rock during a difficult period. </span></p>
<h2><strong><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">Get Informed</span></strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">There is nothing we fear more than the unknown. As long as the mental trauma you have experienced remains unnamed, you view it as this great and terrible thing that can inflict many horrors upon you. You need to remember that most psychological problems can be dealt with using drugs and therapy, and having such problems does not mean your life is over.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">Talk to your therapist to fully understand what your body and your mind are going through. Read up on your condition online from well-respected sources, and get in touch with other people who suffer from the problem to form a network of support.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">If trauma is affecting you, or your loved one, you can <a href="https://www.bluestoneps.com/contact-us/">contact us </a></span><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">and get matched to a therapist to meet your specific needs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;"> </span></p>]]></content:encoded>
