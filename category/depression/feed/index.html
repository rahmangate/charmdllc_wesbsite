				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello Charmdllc Connections Readers!</p>
<p>We are thinking of you all during this challenging time and hoping you and your loved ones are doing well. There are some of you whom we haven’t seen in a while because the initial stay home order was only set to last for 15 days so it didn’t seem like a big deal to wait. Now, however, you may find the stress we are all living with is beginning to grow and take its toll. This may be especially true now that the duration of our required social distancing is extended through April and the news about COVID-19 is not actually getting better or more reassuring.</p>
<p>As we settle into our new normal, I encourage you to consider your self-care more strongly than ever. This is not a sprint but a long-distance event that you will need stamina for to get through. With telehealth being easier to get now, and many insurance companies waiving some consumer’s costs (waived copays, for example, with some insurers), <strong>this is a great time to get started on your journey toward emotional wellness through <a href="https://www.bluestoneps.com/telehealth-counseling/">video counseling</a>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Here are some ideas to keep yourself strong:</strong></p>
<h2>1. Exercise, exercise, exercise!</h2>
<p>It’s clear that since COVID-19, we are moving less and missing out on reducing biochemical stress (being more sedentary delays the release of cortisol and other biological consequences of stress) as well as biomechanical stress (with decreased activity our muscles aren’t releasing physiological tension). We are also missing the opportunity of building the feel-good hormones and maintaining a felt sense of balance and strength in our bodies and the improved cognitive clarity and focus that come with exercise.</p>
<p>There are many ways to exercise even while social distancing:</p>
<p>a. Fortunately, Spring is on its way. Being out of doors can actually be a relief now! It’s a prefect time to get to the walking, running, or biking you’ve been thinking about.</p>
<p>b. Check out your gym’s or studio’s webpage and see if they are live streaming any of their classes.</p>
<p>c. There are a ton of apps and videos available that you can try out – many have free trial periods or are free all the time.</p>
<p>d. Make it fun for the whole family – each family member can take turns finding a free exercise session on YouTube and everyone can do it together. Break into teams, each learning a dance routine and then have a dance off. Create a family Olympics where everyone decides what they want to work on and what their personal best goal is – and then cheer each other on!</p>
<h2>2. Develop a spiritual/contemplative practice.</h2>
<p>We often think this would be a good idea, hear that it is something we “should” do. With more time at home, this could be a perfect opportunity to:</p>
<p>a. Download that inspiring book you’ve always wanted to read from a book store or the library.</p>
<p>b. Watch a movie or Ted Talk that gets you thinking about deeper/bigger things rather than encourages you tune out.</p>
<p>c. Download that meditation app your friend told you about ages ago and give it a try.</p>
<p>d. Ever have a church or other place you thought looked interesting but never had the time to actually go to? Many are now live streaming their lectures/services from their websites and/or social media. It’s a perfect time to check them out!</p>
<p>e. Try journaling – if nothing else, this is a very strange time of constricted movement, changed work/school environment and habits, a major pandemic, and more. There’s certainly more to reflect on and write about!</p>
<h2>3. Take COVID-19 breaks.</h2>
<p>I cannot emphasize this enough! The news about C-19 is constant and yet, relatively little of it is giving us new information. It’s typically report after report about the strain on our medical facilities, risks to medical personnel, threats to our wellbeing, news of increasing numbers of cases and deaths, borders closing and restricted travel around the world, what the latest expert says or politician is or isn’t doing. All the fear and negativity wreaks havoc on our emotions and our bodies.</p>
<p>Here are some ideas to take a break from it all:</p>
<p>a. Decide on one or two news sources you trust and want to follow and then only check in on them once or twice a day for a set amount of time each.</p>
<p>b. Take up gardening. Even if all you have is a tiny balcony, you can start growing vegetable and flower starts to move into a bigger pot as the season progresses. For those with bigger yard space, there’s certainly plenty of Spring clean up to be done now. Maybe this is the year to build that special patio to relax on or rethink a part of your garden beds. You can start preparing those spaces now. You can try growing things from seed, try propagating from plants you already have.</p>
<p>c. There are many “normal” things happening right now too. Make it a point to look for those, notice them, feel them in your body. Is there a favorite tree that is beginning to bloom again? Are you noticing how much longer day light is with us now? Are there certain birds that are coming back to visit the new flowers and berries around you. Take the time to observe and feel it in your body.</p>
<p>d. Get inspired by art and beauty and share it with those important to you:</p>
<p>i. Create new playlists that support your emotional wellbeing.</p>
<p>ii. Find photographs, pieces of art, poems, dance performances, anything that help you express what is in your heart, focusing on gratitude, love, hope.</p>
<p>These are unprecedented times. My grandparents talked about the Great Depression. Relatives talked about living through WWII. My generation had 9-11. Our young people will talk about living through the COVID-19 pandemic. It’s longer term impact on our culture has yet to be seen. While we’re in this part of the experience, there are a number of choices we can make to care for ourselves and to keep our mental, emotional and physical selves strong.</p>
<p><strong>If there is anything we can do for you, please do not hesitate to reach out.</strong> Appointment times are available for new and returning clients. If you’re concerned that having a counseling appointment by video would feel strange or be complicated, please reach out. We would be happy to walk you through the process, including a free 10 minute practice run through so you can learn just how easy it is. <a href="https://www.bluestoneps.com/telehealth-counseling/">Click here</a> for more information about telehealth.</p>
<p>And, in the midst of all this, we are excited to announce a new addition to our panel of therapists. <a href="https://www.bluestoneps.com/therapists-counselors-edmonds/sara-magdaleno-msw-licsw/">Sara Magdaleno, MSW, LICSW</a> brings her talents and interest in working with clients aged 12 through adult to our office. See below for more information.</p>
<p>Take care and be well!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Losing a loved one, whether through death, divorce or a break up, is never easy. When the holidays come around, the weight of your sadness and grief can feel almost crippling. The joy of those around you, pressure to celebrate, and the loss of previously cherished traditions can make every day seem unbearable.</p>
<p>So, how do you get through this unavoidable time when you really just want to sit this one out or wake up when it’s over? While every person’s experience is different, the following coping methods can help you survive the holidays after a loss.</p>
<h2>1. Don’t Put Too Much Pressure on Yourself</h2>
<p>You’re not feeling like yourself this year, and that’s okay. Don’t put too much pressure on yourself to celebrate the same way you did before. If you don’t feel like cooking on Thanksgiving or shopping for gifts, then don’t.</p>
<p>Communicate with your family and friends. Let them know that you just don’t feel up to it and ask for help. They will understand and will be thankful to have an opportunity to make things a bit easier for you.</p>
<h2>2. Create New Traditions</h2>
<p>Reminiscing about cherished traditions after the loss of a loved one or relationship can feel good as well as break your heart. Don’t try to force yourself to keep them going unless you’re really sure that you want to.</p>
<p>Whether it’s putting up decorations, cooking a certain dish, or watching a favorite holiday movie, if the thought of it feels like too much, then give yourself permission to let it go. In the years to come, you’ll either find that interest again or you’ll create new traditions that make the most sense for your changed life.</p>
<h2>3. Take Time for Yourself</h2>
<p>While you don’t want to isolate yourself too much when you’re grieving, you still may find that you need more time for yourself than you did before. Don’t get so caught up in the hustle and bustle of the holidays that you let your self-care slip. It’s more important now than ever. Take naps when you need them, take some time away from work, and recognize when you need to be alone as well as with others.</p>
<p>Holidays tend to be busy with lots of guests around. If things start to feel overwhelming, don’t be afraid to put on your coat and go for a walk or retreat to a quiet room until you feel like you can handle being around people again.</p>
<h2>4. Supporting Your Children</h2>
<p>If you have children, give them space to talk about their feelings of grief and invite them to let you know what they want to make sure you still do during the holidays. Their world has also changed and they will benefit from feeling a sense of control and reassurance that it’s okay to feel happy too. They won’t hurt anyone’s feelings and you may even find a bit of cheer for yourself along the way.</p>
<h2>5. Give Yourself Permission to Feel Sadness and Joy</h2>
<p>While the holidays can make you feel like you need to be happy all the time, this simply isn’t true. Remember that it’s okay to cry. It’s okay to miss your loved one and feel sad about creating a new future without them. Take the time to acknowledge your feelings and let yourself experience them as they are.</p>
<p>Also, don’t beat yourself up when you find yourself smiling, feeling content, or even experiencing joy. Happy moments will come to you, and when they do, give yourself permission to embrace them. No matter how you feel, be authentic. There is no right or wrong way to get through this, and trying to push yourself into something that doesn’t feel right simply takes too much effort.</p>
<h2>Some Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>It may not feel like it right now, but, eventually, life without your loved one will get easier. While the memories of times past will always have a special place in your heart, you’ll also begin to make new memories, create new traditions, and build a life you love living. For now, just settle for taking one day at a time and doing the best you can. That’s all anyone can ask of you and all you should ask of yourself.</p>

<h2>God grant me the Serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference.</h2>



<p>Often
associated with AA, this prayer can be <strong>helpful
for anyone,</strong> not just those in recovery from addiction. Its teaching is
directed toward helping people reduce their desire to control things they
cannot and find the balance between acceptance and change. </p>



<span id="more-2838"></span>



<p><strong>Accepting the universal truth that we
can’t control everything is difficult for most humans.</strong> Culturally, we even
endorse the notion that we can control things:</p>



<ul><li>We tell our children they can be whatever they want to be,
when that’s actually not true. We are not all the same, with the same
intellectual or physical abilities. We each have our unique gifts and abilities
and some ideas we have about what we want to do in our lives will be a good fit
with our gifts and some won’t. </li><li>We are taught, if we want it badly enough and work hard
enough for it, we can have whatever we want. This is also not true. We can’t
control how another person feels about us, the choices they ultimately make. We
can try to influence things, but we can’t control them when another person is
involved, no matter how badly we want it or work at it. Maybe we’ll get that
job and maybe we won’t. Maybe our partner will decide to stay with us and maybe
not.</li></ul>



<p>We
can all struggle with knowing the difference between what we can and can’t
control and struggle with recognizing the difference between the two when they
appear in our lives.&nbsp; Accepting and being
at peace with the idea we can’t control everything and being able to focus on
what we can change is a lifelong journey.</p>



<h2><strong>DON’T GET HUNG UP ON LANGUAGE AND MISS OUT ON THE WISDOM OF
THIS TEACHING </strong></h2>



<p>There
are words in this teaching that can be difficult for some and so they dismiss
it. Words like “prayer” and “God” have clear religious connotations and can
trigger negative memories, associations and emotions for some. If this is true
for you, <strong>these are things you can
control so change them and make it yours.</strong></p>



<p>If
“God” is not a word or concept that brings you comfort or that means anything
to you, change it. Rather than ‘praying to God,’ you might begin: “May I find
the Serenity”, “May I build/grow/create the Serenity”, “May I find peace in
accepting”, or other such variations.</p>



<p>If
the word “Prayer” is a barrier for you, change it. Words like “poem”, “mantra”
and “meditation” work just as well.</p>



<p>The
point of this prayer/mantra is to give you a tool to help remind you of this
universal truth, to help you reset when you become upset by something, and to
help encourage you to go forward in creating the best life you can, even when
it’s uncomfortable or scary. </p>

<p>

Depression is a serious medical condition, but it often goes undetected until the patient is moved to do something drastic under its influence, like self-cutting or a suicide attempt. Here are some signs to look for which indicate a person suffers from depression and needs professional help:

</p>



<span id="more-1447"></span>


<h2><strong>You No Longer Derive Joy from Your Interests</strong></h2>
<p>We all have hobbies that provide us with joy and an interest in life. Whether it&#8217;s a sport, an art form or pop culture consumption, there is always something you do to kick back after working hard at your job all day.</p>
<p>These hobbies and interests are what make life worth living. If you begin to feel you&#8217;re no longer interested in them and constantly experience listlessness and an absence of joy, it may be time to seek help.</p>
<h2><strong>Instead of Therapy, You Self-Medicate</strong></h2>
<p>Some people try to deal with feelings of pain and sadness with drugs and alcohol. If you find yourself consuming large quantities of medicine without getting a prescription from a doctor, remind yourself that you are only succeeding in temporarily blocking the pain out in a drug-induced stupor instead of getting cured.</p>
<p>If you want to genuinely get better, you will need to go to a licensed professional who will tell you which drugs, if any, you should be taking to deal with your problems.</p>
<h2><strong>Depression Starts Affecting Work</strong></h2>
<p>One of the most common symptoms of depression is when you no longer feel strong enough to face the world. This can result in your shutting out the difficult parts of your life by not leaving your house, even to go to work.</p>
<p>This behavior has a very negative effect, both in the short term in terms of feeding your paranoia, and in the long term in terms of affecting your financial independence and professional reputation.</p>
<h2><strong>You Spend Too Much Time Fantasizing</strong></h2>
<p>When real life carries no joy, often we try to take refuge in an imaginary world of our own making. We might try to lose ourselves in video games, movies or online chat forums, but all we&#8217;re doing is temporarily avoiding our rapidly mounting real-life problems.</p>
<p>If you find yourself spending too much time lost in daydreams as a way to push away reality, it&#8217;s a strong sign that you will need outside help from a professional to deal with your depression.</p>
<h2><strong>Other People Notice Your State</strong></h2>
<p>You may try to convince yourself that you are merely going through a bad patch and that your problems are nothing serious, but what about when your issues start affecting those close to you, and they begin to comment on it?</p>
<p>This is a clear sign that your problems are much more serious than you had imagined, and need to be addressed with the help of a professional. Don&#8217;t be ashamed to take your relatives into your confidence. You will need their support to get better.</p>
<h2><strong>You Consider Self-Harm instead of Seeking Help</strong></h2>
<p>There is never, and I mean NEVER, a good reason to try to hurt yourself. The impulse to injure your body or take your own life is a result of long-term depression and a general feeling of helplessness. You feel you don&#8217;t control your own life and can never experience happiness again, but this is not true.</p>
<p>Talk to a professional, take help from relatives, and get the medical assistance you need to get back to your normal life. Life is never perfect for anyone, but amidst all the difficulties, there are still many new experiences to be enjoyed that make life worth living.</p>
<p>If depression is affecting you, or your loved one, you can <a href="https://www.bluestoneps.com/contact-us/">contact us</a> and get matched to a therapist to meet your specific needs.</p>]]></content:encoded>
