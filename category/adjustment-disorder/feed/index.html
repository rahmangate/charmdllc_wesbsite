<p>Work problems, going away to school, an illness — any
number of life changes can cause stress. Most of the time, people adjust to
such changes within a few months. But if you continue to feel down or
self-destructive, you may have an adjustment disorder.</p>



<p>Work problems, going away to school, an illness — any
number of life changes can cause stress. Most of the time, people adjust to
such changes within a few months. But if you continue to feel down or
self-destructive, you may have an adjustment disorder.</p>



<span id="more-2731"></span>



<p>An adjustment disorder is a type of stress-related mental illness. You may <a href="https://www.bluestoneps.com/therapy-counseling-edmonds/anxiety-and-chronic-worry-therapy/">feel anxious</a> or <a href="https://www.bluestoneps.com/therapy-counseling-edmonds/counseling-for-depression/">depressed</a>, or even have thoughts of suicide. Your normal daily routines may feel overwhelming. Or you may make reckless decisions. In essence, you have a hard time adjusting to change in your life, and it has serious consequences.</p>



<p>You don&#8217;t have to tough it out on your own, though.
Adjustment disorder treatment — usually brief — is likely to help you regain
your emotional footing.</p>



<p>Adjustment disorders symptoms vary
from person to person. The symptoms you have may be different from those of
someone else with an adjustment disorder. But for everyone, symptoms of an
adjustment disorder begin within three months of a stressful event in your
life.</p>



<p><strong>Emotional
symptoms of adjustment disorders</strong></p>



<p>Signs and symptoms of adjustment
disorder may affect how you feel and think about yourself or life, including:</p>



<ul><li>Sadness</li><li>Hopelessness</li><li>Lack of enjoyment</li><li>Crying spells</li><li>Nervousness</li><li>Jitteriness</li><li>Anxiety, which may include separation anxiety</li><li>Worry</li><li>Desperation</li><li>Trouble sleeping</li><li>Difficulty concentrating</li><li>Feeling overwhelmed</li><li>Thoughts of suicide</li></ul>



<p><strong>Behavioral
symptoms of adjustment disorders</strong></p>



<p>Signs and symptoms of adjustment
disorder may affect your actions or behavior, such as:</p>



<ul><li>Fighting</li><li>Reckless driving</li><li>Ignoring bills</li><li>Avoiding family or friends</li><li>Performing poorly in school or at work</li><li>Skipping school</li><li>Vandalizing property</li></ul>



<p><strong>Length
of symptoms</strong></p>



<p>How long you have symptoms of an
adjustment disorder also can vary:</p>



<ul><li><strong>6 months or less (acute).</strong> In these cases, symptoms should ease once the stressor is removed. Brief professional treatment may help symptoms disappear.</li><li><strong>More than 6 months (chronic).</strong> In these cases, symptoms continue to bother you and disrupt your life. Professional treatment may help symptoms improve and prevent the condition from continuing to get worse.</li></ul>



<p><strong>When
to see a doctor</strong></p>



<p>Sometimes the stressful change in
your life goes away, and your symptoms of adjustment disorder get better
because the stress has eased. But often, the stressful event remains a part of
your life. Or a new stressful situation comes up, and you face the same
emotional struggles all over again.</p>



<p>Talk to your doctor if you&#8217;re having
trouble getting through each day. You can get treatment to help you cope better
with stressful events and feel better about life again.</p>



<p><strong>If
you have suicidal thoughts</strong></p>



<p>If you or someone you know has
thoughts of suicide, get help right away. Consider talking to your doctor,
nurse, a mental health professional, a trusted family member or friend, or your
faith leader.</p>



<p>If you think you may hurt yourself
or attempt suicide, call 911 or your local emergency number immediately. Or
call a suicide hot line number. In the United States, you can call the 24-hour
National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 800-273-8255 (toll-free) to talk with a
trained counselor.</p>



<p>Researchers are still trying to figure out
what causes adjustment disorders. As with other mental disorders, the cause is
likely complex and may involve genetics, your life experiences, your
temperament and even changes in the natural chemicals in the brain.</p>



<p>Although the cause of adjustment
disorders is unknown, some things make you more likely to have an adjustment
disorder. Among children and teenagers, both boys and girls have about the same
chance of having adjustment disorders. Among adults, women are twice as likely
to be diagnosed with adjustment disorders.</p>



<p><strong>Stressful
events</strong></p>



<p>One or more stressful life events
may put you at risk of developing an adjustment disorder. It may involve almost
any type of stressful event in your life. Both positive and negative events can
cause extreme stress. Some common examples include:</p>



<ul><li>Being diagnosed with a serious illness</li><li>Problems in school</li><li>Divorce or relationship breakup</li><li>Job loss</li><li>Having a baby</li><li>Financial problems</li><li>Physical assault</li><li>Surviving a disaster</li><li>Retirement</li><li>Death of a loved one</li><li>Going away to school</li></ul>



<p>In some cases, people who face an
ongoing stressful situation — such as living in a crime-ridden neighborhood —
can reach a breaking point and develop an adjustment disorder.</p>



<p><strong>Your
life experiences</strong></p>



<p>If you generally don&#8217;t cope well
with change or you don&#8217;t have a strong support system, you may be more likely
to have an extreme reaction to a stressful event.</p>



<p>Your risk of an adjustment disorder
may be higher if you experienced stress in early childhood. Overprotective or
abusive parenting, family disruptions, and frequent moves early in life may
make you feel like you&#8217;re unable to control events in your life. When difficulties
then arise, you may have trouble coping.</p>



<p>Other risk factors may include:</p>



<ul><li>Other mental health problems</li><li>Exposure to wars or violence</li><li>Difficult life circumstances</li></ul>



<p>Most adults with adjustment disorder
get better within six months and don&#8217;t have long-term complications. However,
people who also have another mental health disorder, a substance abuse problem
or a chronic adjustment disorder are more likely to have long-term mental
health problems, which may include:</p>
