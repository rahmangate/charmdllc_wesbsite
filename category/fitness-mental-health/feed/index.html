<p>We all know we <em>should</em>
exercise for our physical, mental and emotional health. But what if we really
don’t enjoy it? For those of us who are not innately thrilled to be going to
the gym and working out on the weight machines or cardio machines to nowhere, following
through on our exercise goals can be the most difficult part of keeping a
healthy living routine. This is especially true during the many months of cold,
rainy weather in the Northwest.&nbsp; Here are
a couple tips to support you in your goals toward healthy living:</p>



<span id="more-2594"></span>



<h2><strong>1. Don’t
focus on how much you don’t want to do it: </strong></h2>



<p>Once there you may be able to get into your workout
and not mind it so much. A client told me if she can walk for at least 24
minutes, she’ll make her 60 minutes goal. She doesn’t know why this turning
point happens at that time, but knowing that it’s there, helps her persist in
going for the walk and staying at it long enough to reach the good feeling.
Another client used the sensation of diving into the pool as her carrot to get
there. She confessed she never actually wanted to go to the pool, but by
focusing on the sensations of entering the water, which was her favorite part,
she was able to get herself there consistently.</p>



<p>In addition, keep in mind that the feeling of
accomplishment and better energy and mood after the workout can even make you
glad you went. Think about how your self-esteem will strengthen saying, ‘today
I did that’ rather than feeling sheepish and upset with yourself for not going.
Endless studies support the boost in mood and energy as well as improved sleep
that result from exercise. Your stress level will come down and your patience
will go up. </p>



<p>Rather than focusing your thoughts on how you should
go exercise and on how much you don’t want to go,<strong> focus on feeling good once you’re there and on how good you’ll feel
afterward. </strong></p>



<h2><strong>2. Figure
out what will inspire or energize you while you’re exercising:</strong></h2>



<p>Nothing is worse than walking on a treadmill facing a
wall or running the same route over and over again. What will help you feel
good while you’re exercising? Is it a podcast? A certain music playlist? A book
you never seem to get to? A movie you want to watch on some device while using
a machine? Is there someone who will go with you sometimes? A team you can
join/create to share the different legs of a triathlon? A goal, like you’re
first 5K?</p>



<p>It’s easy to get in a rut and have your program feel
boring. <strong>Try different things, be
creative and mix it up.</strong></p>
