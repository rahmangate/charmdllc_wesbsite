				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Valentine&#8217;s Day has long been known as a holiday that celebrates love and romance. While most people think of this as a holiday for couples, there&#8217;s nothing that says romantic love is the only kind worth celebrating.</p>
<p>Whether or not you&#8217;re currently part of a happy couple, opening your mind and expanding your thoughts about love can give you a whole new perspective. Here are a few ways to honor different types of love all month long.</p>
<h2>Focus on Your Family and Friends</h2>
<p>Many of us have a special bond with at least one family member. Take a moment to think about all the good times you&#8217;ve had together and see how that makes you feel. Then, reach out and let them know just how much you love and appreciate them.</p>
<p>The same goes for friends. If you have a best friend who has been there for you through thick and thin, use this opportunity to tell them what their love and support means to you. Have a close-knit group of friends? Make plans to spend some time together so you can all appreciate the love you have for one another.</p>
<h2>Appreciate Your Pet&#8217;s Unconditional Love</h2>
<p>Few things can make you feel more special than the unconditional love of an animal. If you have a pet in your life, take some extra time this month to cuddle, play, or just bask in their affection. Maybe even pick up a special treat or a new toy to show your love in a language they understand.</p>
<p>If you sometimes feel like you love your dog more than most people, you&#8217;re not alone. In fact, a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/humans-love-dogs-more-than-other-humans-2017-11">recent study</a> showed that many people feel more empathy for dogs than their fellow humans. There&#8217;s also nothing wrong with letting your dog snuggle up in bed with you. <a href="https://nypost.com/2018/11/27/women-sleep-better-next-to-dogs-than-humans-study/">Another study</a> showed that most women actually sleep better next to their dogs than they do next to their human partners! So count yourself in good company and enjoy your time with the furry love of your life.</p>
<h2>Learn to Love Life&#8217;s Little Joys</h2>
<p>Perhaps one of the most important life lessons is that you don&#8217;t actually need a companion at all to experience the thrill of love. Start paying extra attention to the things you really enjoy doing and the way they make you feel.</p>
<p>When you&#8217;re engaged in your favorite activity, does your heart beat a little bit faster? Do you feel a bit of a tingle or flutter? When you&#8217;re done, do you have a feeling of fulfillment or satisfaction? Guess what &#8212; that&#8217;s love too!</p>
<h2>Celebrate Love in Different Ways All Month Long</h2>
<p>Once you begin honoring different kinds of love, you&#8217;ll feel incredibly fulfilled and have a whole new sense of satisfaction. This new outlook will also bring a renewed sense of joy that you can celebrate during the Month of Love and throughout the rest of the year.</p>
