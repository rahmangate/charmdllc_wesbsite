				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>As of Monday, March 23rd, We&#8217;ve Gone 100% Virtual!</h2>
<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 75%; height: 0;"><iframe style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;" src="https://www.loom.com/embed/72ad395e53ea4c8dbd209b9d6a9fbe44" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div>
<p>Hello Everyone!</p>
<p>First, I want to say thank you for taking this unexpected journey with us. These are rapidly changing times, requiring us all to be flexible and shift to new ways of doing things. How we “go to work,” how the kids still “go to school,” how we connect with our friends and families, as well as how we engage in previous activities that we’d taken for granted has all been turned upside down. This has, of course, also impacted how we run the Charmd office and engage in therapy, both as clients and as therapists.</p>
<p>I look forward to the day when we are looking at this experience in the rear-view mirror but realize this may go on for some time. In response to our state lawmakers and CDC guidelines to minimize exposure, we have spent this last week finalizing how we will move Charmd operations, therapy and medication management services into the digital world. You may have already heard from your therapist, but if you haven’t,<strong> on Monday, March 23rd, Charmd is moving all of its services to a telehealth format.</strong> I am happy to say, we are gaining fluidity and confidence in the new procedures and so are our clients. We are so pleased to be getting really positive feedback from those clients who have already tried it!</p>
<p>I wanted to send you all a note about what this move to telehealth means for you:</p>
<p><strong>1. Your therapists are ready for you!</strong> We have a fully HIPAA compliant video and phone system for telehealth and all of our therapists are trained in how to use it. They have training in delivering telehealth and have actually found it working quite well with the sessions they have already done. <strong>You are important to us and we want to be here with you and for you.</strong> At least through March, some of the HIPAA restrictions have been lifted, making it easier for telehealth services to be provided. You can meet us by phone and/or through our video platform, which clients have found easy to learn.</p>
<p><strong>2. Nothing has changed in our <a href="https://www.bluestoneps.com/patient-portal/">Patient Portal</a>,</strong> w<strong>hich you can continue to access from our website.</strong> You can still manage appointments, update information, and email your therapist confidentially using your same user name and password.</p>
<p>To reach your therapist most easily, please call their extensions:</p>
<p><strong>Randie Clark, x708</strong><br />
<strong>Emily Visser, x710</strong><br />
<strong>Terri Buysse, x706</strong></p>
<p><strong>Julie Hanson, x 701</strong><br />
<strong>Terri Haaga, x714</strong><br />
<strong>Kristi Leksen, x704</strong></p>
<p><strong>Bill Roedel, x 702</strong><br />
<strong>Cherrie Palmer, x712</strong><br />
<strong>Stephanie Bates, x705</strong></p>
<p><strong>Doralissa Griffin, x707</strong><br />
<strong>Kristin Mendoza, x703</strong><br />
<strong>Skye Camphouse, x716</strong></p>
<p><strong>3. Please do not terminate your care.</strong> These are unprecedented times and I know you may feel like you can’t possibly do one more thing, take one more change. While I appreciate the jokes about how busy maternity wards will be in nine months, I am also aware of how stress and disruption in routines that are outside of our control can wreak havoc on our patience, communication skills, sleep, energy levels, and moods. Keeping the support of and connection with your therapist can help you navigate this uninvited time of change and come out strong.</p>
<p>If you do feel a need to end care for a while, we encourage you to have a termination appointment so we can help you build up your care plan going forward. When compared to an unplanned, abrupt ending, a planned termination has been shown to significantly improve a client’s success after care. If you still want to end your care, at least for now, and would like to return at a later time, just give us a call and we will get you back on your therapist’s schedule as soon as we can. We unfortunately cannot hold appointment times indefinitely.</p>
<p>4. If you had already ended a previous episode of care and now want to return, just give Kayla a call or send us an email at <a href="mailto:wehelp@charmdllc.com">wehelp@charmdllc.com</a>. You may find yourself slipping a bit as you go through all these changes. This is completely understandable and we welcome the opportunity to reconnect you with your therapist or match you with a new one. If you are working from home, you may have greater flexibility in your schedule. Not having to travel to and from the office may make it easier to fit an appointment into your day. We can vary lengths of appointments to help with cost and time constraints. Just let us know if you’d like to “come in” for a booster!</p>
<p><strong>5. We will need to verify the benefits again for several insurance plans.</strong> Many insurance companies have had a strong, supportive response in order to decrease barriers to telehealth services, which has been wonderful! However, it is not true for all insurance plans. This is most notable with self-funded plans. We want to decrease stress for you as much as possible, so please be patient as we attempt to verify telehealth benefits for each of you. You may receive a call or new payment agreement form about this from Rachel or Asya in our billing department, or from your therapist. You are also welcome to give billing a call or send an email to <a href="mailto:wehelp@charmdllc.com">wehelp@charmdllc.com</a>.</p>
<p>For now, please just come to your appointments and we will figure out the other bits as we go, including considering sliding fees for those who have lost jobs and income during this time. Varying the lengths of appointments can also help mediate cost, if needed. Let’s work together!</p>
<p><strong>6. Our staff are ready for you!</strong> We are still “here” at the same email addresses and phone numbers. Kayla is still available for front desk tasks at <strong>425-775-4059, x2</strong> and <a href="mailto:wehelp@charmdllc.com">wehelp@charmdllc.com</a>. Rachel and Asya are still available for billing questions at <strong>425-775-4059, x3</strong> and <a href="mailto:wehelp@charmdllc.com">wehelp@charmdllc.com</a>.</p>
<p>We love what we do and being able to answer the call to be of service. We look forward to continuing your care with as little disruption to you as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Please keep looking for and reading the newsletters and therapist emails you will be receiving with greater frequency now so we can stay in communication with you. I will also be posting updates here on our website</strong><strong style="font-size: 1rem;"> and our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/BluestonePS/?__tn__=%2Cd%2CP-R&amp;eid=ARAo0XJrd1Qvx5-j7RR9TjCIGjs9SX96j6RJxIhzzccbBWmN3B_gp5ibRdUHPwB-RUuyD0cJniSDp1Z5">Facebook page</a>.</strong></p>
<p>Here’s to your health and seeing you on the other side!</p>
<p>Take very good care,</p>
<p>Julie Hanson, Psy.D,. LMHC<br />
Director, Charmd Psychological Services</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p></p>



<p>We all know we <em>should</em>
exercise for our physical, mental and emotional health. But what if we really
don’t enjoy it? For those of us who are not innately thrilled to be going to
the gym and working out on the weight machines or cardio machines to nowhere, following
through on our exercise goals can be the most difficult part of keeping a
healthy living routine. This is especially true during the many months of cold,
rainy weather in the Northwest.&nbsp; Here are
a couple tips to support you in your goals toward healthy living:</p>



<span id="more-2594"></span>



<h2><strong>1. Don’t
focus on how much you don’t want to do it: </strong></h2>



<p>Once there you may be able to get into your workout
and not mind it so much. A client told me if she can walk for at least 24
minutes, she’ll make her 60 minutes goal. She doesn’t know why this turning
point happens at that time, but knowing that it’s there, helps her persist in
going for the walk and staying at it long enough to reach the good feeling.
Another client used the sensation of diving into the pool as her carrot to get
there. She confessed she never actually wanted to go to the pool, but by
focusing on the sensations of entering the water, which was her favorite part,
she was able to get herself there consistently.</p>



<p>In addition, keep in mind that the feeling of
accomplishment and better energy and mood after the workout can even make you
glad you went. Think about how your self-esteem will strengthen saying, ‘today
I did that’ rather than feeling sheepish and upset with yourself for not going.
Endless studies support the boost in mood and energy as well as improved sleep
that result from exercise. Your stress level will come down and your patience
will go up. </p>



<p>Rather than focusing your thoughts on how you should
go exercise and on how much you don’t want to go,<strong> focus on feeling good once you’re there and on how good you’ll feel
afterward. </strong></p>



<h2><strong>2. Figure
out what will inspire or energize you while you’re exercising:</strong></h2>



<p>Nothing is worse than walking on a treadmill facing a
wall or running the same route over and over again. What will help you feel
good while you’re exercising? Is it a podcast? A certain music playlist? A book
you never seem to get to? A movie you want to watch on some device while using
a machine? Is there someone who will go with you sometimes? A team you can
join/create to share the different legs of a triathlon? A goal, like you’re
first 5K?</p>



<p>It’s easy to get in a rut and have your program feel
boring. <strong>Try different things, be
creative and mix it up.</strong></p>

<p>The end of the year holidays often bring a mixture of emotions for people. Excitement, hope and joy are all emotions we may experience as we look forward to seeing people we haven’t seen in a while, return to places we are connected to, and think of gifts to give to loved ones. The holidays bring unique experiences we wait all year for like baking special breads and preparing special foods, listening to music and singing songs unique to this time of year, decorating our homes with special lighting and meaningful items. The kids have an extended time out of school and those who are away often come home, vacations are planned and enjoyed. As a year is coming to an end, it’s also often a time for reflection and planning for the new year. </p>



<span id="more-2283"></span>


<p>With so much going on, this can also be a time for sadness, disappointment, and stress. Perhaps this is the first holiday without a loved one. Seeing the empty place at the table or thinking of getting through the new year without someone to celebrate with can be painful. Homecomings can be fraught with tension and distress as old, unhealed hurts are poked again. Perhaps finances are tighter than before.</p>
<p>There is a lot of pressure at this time of year to produce something: post excellent year end numbers for work; present a model like appearance for a party; create an amazing holiday party; send out the perfect family holiday card; make sure each side of your family feels equally attended to. Beginning before Thanksgiving now there are constant messages to spend money and look happy. Whether the holiday season has a religious focus for you or not, we are bombarded by messages about making others happy through spending. <strong>Getting through this time of year with grace and ease is possible. </strong></p>
<p>Beyond the religious element, there are many opportunities that come through the fall and winter. As the days get shorter, colder, darker, wetter, and grayer, we spend more time in doors. This offers us the opportunity to slow down and in slowing down, an opportunity to reflect and appreciate. Beginning with Thanksgiving, it’s a time to think about all those things you are grateful for: loved ones and friendship, health, community, purpose, activities you enjoy, and so much more. It doesn’t mean everything in your life or the world is perfect. It doesn’t mean denying that there isn’t much pain and injustice around us. It means that these good things are also true and it’s important to honor them as well. <strong>Spending time focusing on the good things in your life, even if the list seems filled with inconsequential things, will help cultivate a positive mood and a sense of calm.</strong></p>
<p>As you spend less time out doing things, you are also presented with a great opportunity to reflect on your year and assess where you are in your life. Again, you may not be exactly where you thought you’d be or where you think you ought to be, but acknowledge those things you have learned, begun, or accomplished in the last year. And then you can begin thinking about where you would like to take your life in the upcoming year and ponder how you might achieve those goals. Remember to include lighthearted and fun goals as well. Cooking class? New garden bed design for your yard? Dance class? A travel adventure?<strong><a href="https://www.bluestoneps.com/preparing-for-those-new-years-resolutions/"> See our blog post about SMART goal setting to stack the success cards in your favor</a>.</strong> Again, creating a balance of goals that are challenging and goals that are fun will keep your life interesting and engaging.</p>
<p>Even if this is not a religious holiday for you, you can take a que from its celebratory nature. With all the gloomy dark and dampness, how do you want to make your home feel cozy? How do you want to acknowledge those who are most important to you with a joyous activity or meal? How might you cultivate a spirit of giving and generosity that will extend beyond the holidays? <strong>Have you taken time to examine and honor transformative moments in your life? </strong>What was it about those moments or about those people who came into your life that inspired you to see yourself differently and influenced the trajectory of your life? Take time to reflect on the learning and gifts of those moments/people and how you can continue to honor them and build on them in the upcoming year.</p>
<p>While your mood and energy levels may be influenced by the fall, winter and early spring weather in the Pacific Northwest and you may struggle with endless bombardment of commercials and holiday music, there are ways to bring your own take on the opportunities presented during this time. Intentionally engaging in those things that are meaningful to you, keeping realistic expectations about how various events will go, and balancing challenging things with joyous things will help you experience both ease and grace in your life. Enjoy!</p>]]></content:encoded>

<h2><strong>S.M.A.R.T. Goals to Make a Change:</strong></h2>



<p>A goal should do more than simply state a desire. A well-constructed goal should also provide guidance and direction. Goals like ‘lose weight’, ‘eat better’, or ‘have less stress’ are far too vague to be much help in making change.</p>



<p>To be more successful in attaining your goals, S.M.A.R.T. offers a framework upon which you can build more detail into your goal. Spending some time creating effective goals will be a huge help later on.</p>



<span id="more-2269"></span>


<h2>S &#8211; Specific:</h2>
<ul>
<li>A useful goal is clear and specific: “Lose 20 pounds” is clearer and more specific than “Lose weight”</li>
<li>By putting more effort into clarity, you can go even further, saying, “lose 20 pounds by taking a brisk, 30 minute walks 4 times a week and by using salad plates for meals to decrease my portion sizes.”</li>
<li>Goals stated this way give you a target as well as instructions on how to reach it.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>M &#8211; Measurable:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Measuring your progress provides accountability, which helps you stay on track, and helps you know if your approach is working or not. Taking the time to measure progress gives you the chance to celebrate accomplishments and make adjustments as needed.</li>
<li>Some goals are easier to measure than others. Losing 20 pounds can easily be measured by a scale, for example. If you can’t think of a good way to measure your progress, you probably need to work more on your goal statement. Revisit your goal and keep working at it until you have created something that you can also measure in some way.</li>
<li>You may have to also be creative in coming up with a tool to measure your goal. You can approach it from both sides.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>A &#8211; Attainable:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>A goal is more likely to be attainable if it is meaningful to you. If losing 20 pounds is not meaningful to you on its own, it’s not likely you will put forth the effort to actually do it and then maintain it.</li>
<li>However, if the goal of being a part your family’s active summer adventures is meaningful to you and your weight is a barrier to that goal, losing the weight may now take on meaning to you.</li>
<li>The goal should be inspiring enough that it motivates you to success. If you are not determined to meet your goal, obstacles will be very difficult to overcome.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>R &#8211; Realistic:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Goals should be ambitious, but not impossible.</li>
<li>Choose a goal that pushes you out of your comfort zone that you are confident you can reach.</li>
<li>Break large goals into smaller even more specific goals so you can plan out and take the steps needed to reach the bigger goal.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>T – Time Based :</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Setting a time by which you want to have accomplished goals should be guided by all the work you have done up to this point.</li>
<li>Choosing a time is important as it helps you build in whatever preparation you need to be ready to start (e.g., nutrition counseling to build healthy meals, any help you need to prepare for your increased exercise), and then gives you a clear start date. It also gives you an end date so you can hold that vision in front of you of you having reached your goal.</li>
<li>When setting a time, you can again be very specific so that you have clear, measurable, and realistic goals. You could say, “In 3 months I will have lost 20 pounds.” Or you could say, “I will lose an average of 2 pounds every week for 10 weeks.”</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Write your goal down:</strong></h2>
<p>Now really think about your goal. Using the guidelines above, write it down and put it somewhere you can see it.</p>
<h2><strong>Share your goal for encouragement and accountability:</strong></h2>
<p>Once you have your goal written down, share it with someone important to you whom you know will be able to provide you with support and encouragement. People who share their goals out loud to others and have support are more likely to reach their goals than people who keep them to themselves. Sharing with a therapist is always an option too!</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Our minds are delicate things. Traumatic events cause not only physical injury, but their effects on our minds are often just as severe, and much harder to recover from. Here are some of the steps you need to take for emotional and psychological recovery after such incidents: </p>



<span id="more-1449"></span>


<h2><strong><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">Confront the Issue</span></strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">The mental trauma you experience may have been brought upon by any number of factors. It may be something that happened a long time ago. It may have happened recently. You may been subjected to physical injury or mental torture. Whatever the cause, the first step towards recovery is accepting that you have a problem.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">There are many symptoms of mental stress you need to be aware of. You may find yourself developing irrational mood swings or going into a state of depression. You may experience feelings of guilt or thoughts of self-harm. Your body might respond to ordinary events with an increased heartbeat, sweating or panic attacks. Keep track of all these symptoms and try to deduce which traumatic event from your past may have triggered them.</span></p>
<h2><strong><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">Seek Trauma Therapy</span></strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">Your mind is incredibly complex, and trying to cure it on your own can result in futile or even disastrous results. Buying medicine without a prescription can result in drug abuse and dependency. Thinking the problem will go away or lessen over time is also not healthy. Neither is going online to search for answers on chat forums, since the internet plays host to a vast amount of misinformation and untruths.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">Seeking the help of a professional is sometimes considered shameful or unnecessary, but remember that just like doctors are trained to treat the body, psychologists are trained to treat minds. They are there to help, but you need to take the first step by seeking them out.</span></p>
<h2><strong><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">Exercise for Psychological Relief</span></strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">Trauma affects your nervous system by lowering endorphin levels and pumping out chemicals which promote hyper-arousal and fear. The best way to fight this reaction is by forcing your body to take part in some vigorous, but non-dangerous exercise. Your body will slowly return to a state of normalcy, and you will be subjected to fresh endorphins which will help bring down anxiety levels. </span></p>
<h2><strong><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">Connect with Loved Ones</span></strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">We all have people in our lives who we are close to, and who value us. Get in touch with those people and spend time with them on normal things. Go see a movie, take part in some group activity or just stay at home to watch TV. The aim is to return to a feeling of normalcy after the traumatic experience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">If it appears your psychological problems will require professional trauma therapy, don&#8217;t try to hide the fact from your friends. Take them into your confidence, and they will help you adjust to your new reality. They can drop you off at the therapist&#8217;s office, go with you for appointments and generally be your rock during a difficult period. </span></p>
<h2><strong><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">Get Informed</span></strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">There is nothing we fear more than the unknown. As long as the mental trauma you have experienced remains unnamed, you view it as this great and terrible thing that can inflict many horrors upon you. You need to remember that most psychological problems can be dealt with using drugs and therapy, and having such problems does not mean your life is over.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">Talk to your therapist to fully understand what your body and your mind are going through. Read up on your condition online from well-respected sources, and get in touch with other people who suffer from the problem to form a network of support.</span></p>

Depression is a serious medical condition, but it often goes undetected until the patient is moved to do something drastic under its influence, like self-cutting or a suicide attempt. Here are some signs to look for which indicate a person suffers from depression and needs professional help:

</p>

<h2><strong>You No Longer Derive Joy from Your Interests</strong></h2>
<p>We all have hobbies that provide us with joy and an interest in life. Whether it&#8217;s a sport, an art form or pop culture consumption, there is always something you do to kick back after working hard at your job all day.</p>
<p>These hobbies and interests are what make life worth living. If you begin to feel you&#8217;re no longer interested in them and constantly experience listlessness and an absence of joy, it may be time to seek help.</p>
<h2><strong>Instead of Therapy, You Self-Medicate</strong></h2>
<p>Some people try to deal with feelings of pain and sadness with drugs and alcohol. If you find yourself consuming large quantities of medicine without getting a prescription from a doctor, remind yourself that you are only succeeding in temporarily blocking the pain out in a drug-induced stupor instead of getting cured.</p>
<p>If you want to genuinely get better, you will need to go to a licensed professional who will tell you which drugs, if any, you should be taking to deal with your problems.</p>
<h2><strong>Depression Starts Affecting Work</strong></h2>
<p>One of the most common symptoms of depression is when you no longer feel strong enough to face the world. This can result in your shutting out the difficult parts of your life by not leaving your house, even to go to work.</p>
<p>This behavior has a very negative effect, both in the short term in terms of feeding your paranoia, and in the long term in terms of affecting your financial independence and professional reputation.</p>
<h2><strong>You Spend Too Much Time Fantasizing</strong></h2>
<p>When real life carries no joy, often we try to take refuge in an imaginary world of our own making. We might try to lose ourselves in video games, movies or online chat forums, but all we&#8217;re doing is temporarily avoiding our rapidly mounting real-life problems.</p>
<p>If you find yourself spending too much time lost in daydreams as a way to push away reality, it&#8217;s a strong sign that you will need outside help from a professional to deal with your depression.</p>
<h2><strong>Other People Notice Your State</strong></h2>
<p>You may try to convince yourself that you are merely going through a bad patch and that your problems are nothing serious, but what about when your issues start affecting those close to you, and they begin to comment on it?</p>
<p>This is a clear sign that your problems are much more serious than you had imagined, and need to be addressed with the help of a professional. Don&#8217;t be ashamed to take your relatives into your confidence. You will need their support to get better.</p>
<h2><strong>You Consider Self-Harm instead of Seeking Help</strong></h2>
<p>There is never, and I mean NEVER, a good reason to try to hurt yourself. The impulse to injure your body or take your own life is a result of long-term depression and a general feeling of helplessness. You feel you don&#8217;t control your own life and can never experience happiness again, but this is not true.</p>
<p>Talk to a professional, take help from relatives, and get the medical assistance you need to get back to your normal life. Life is never perfect for anyone, but amidst all the difficulties, there are still many new experiences to be enjoyed that make life worth living.</p>
