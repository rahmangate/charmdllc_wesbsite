				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Stress</strong> is an everyday part of our lives and a normal physical and mental response to a situation where one feel’s under pressure or overwhelmed. Stress disturbs or interferes with the normal physiological equilibrium of an organism. Basically, we are out of balance.</p>
<p>In older adults, stress is thought to play a bigger role in triggering <a href="https://www.bluestoneps.com/therapy-counseling-edmonds/counseling-for-depression/">depression</a> and/or <a href="https://www.bluestoneps.com/therapy-counseling-edmonds/anxiety-and-chronic-worry-therapy/">anxiety</a> than in other age groups. Aging brings special pressures, unique life upsets and key biological changes – but they need not result in long standing psychological disorders if addressed early.</p>
<p>We all know that life is stressful. The question is how do we respond to it? Stress reduction is about shifting from reacting to responding.</p>
<p>The first step in stress management is awareness! A person needs to be able to feel and know they are experiencing stress.  Once a person is aware, mindfulness techniques and coping strategies can be done.</p>
<h2>Two quick steps to help you to come back to yourself/the present moment are:</h2>
<ol>
<li>Pause and take 3 deep breaths</li>
<li>Ask yourself the questions: “what is going on with me right now?” and “what can I do to bring myself back to the moment?”</li>
</ol>
<p>From here, you may have a couple of solutions to help you manage your immediate stress and move forward in a calmer way.</p>
<p>If you find that there is “too much” going on in your life right now, and you are feeling overwhelmed, schedule an appointment with <a href="https://www.bluestoneps.com/therapists-counselors-edmonds/terri-haaga-msw-licsw/">Terri Haaga</a> and she will be happy to assist you in developing a stress reduction plan for you or someone you care about.</p>
